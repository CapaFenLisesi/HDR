abstract = {Progress in experiment and simulation capability in the lower hybrid range of frequencies at ITER relevant parameters is reviewed. Use of LH power in reactor devices is motivated in terms of its potential for efficient off-axis current profile control. Recent improvements in simulation capability including the development of full-wave field solvers, inclusion of the scrape off layer (SOL) in wave propagation codes, the use of coupled ray tracing/full-wave/3D (r v?, v//) Fokker Planck models, and the inclusion of wave scattering as well as nonlinear broadening effects in ray tracing / Fokker Planck codes are discussed. Experimental and modeling results are reviewed which are aimed at understanding the spectral gap problem in LH current drive (LHCD) and the density limit that has been observed and mitigated in LHCD experiments. Physics mechanisms that could be operative in these experiments are discussed, including toroidally induced variations in the parallel wavenumber, nonlinear broadening of the pump wave, scattering of LH waves from density fluctuations in the SOL, and spectral broadening at the plasma edge via full-wave effects.},

@article{Brambilla1983,
abstract = {The authors have investigated quasi-linear ion Landau damping of lower hybrid waves in an inhomogeneous plasma. To this end, they have simultaneously solved Maxwell equations and the ion kinetic equation, starting from the antenna and proceeding towards the centre of a plane-layered plasma. As a consequence of the development of a suprathermal tail in the ion distribution function, the efficiency of the absorption increases and the absorption region is found to shift to lower densities as the launched power increases. Absorption is always complete at the layer where the wave phase velocity equals about three times the local ion thermal velocity, usually somewhat before the linear turning point is reached.},

@inproceedings{Motley1985,
abstract = {A study of radiofrequency current ramp-up in the PLT tokamak is reported. The plasma current was first raised to 200–300 kA by the Ohmic heating transformer, and the current in the transformer primary circuit was then held constant to remove the OH drive. After the current fell below 200 kA, up to 300 kW of toroidally-directed RF power at 800 MHz was transmitted into the PLT plasma via a 6-element phased waveguide array. Current ramp-up rates between 0 and 120 kA/s for a 0.35 s time interval ((½–1/3) L/R time) where measured at densities between 2 and 4 × 1012 cm−3. It is estimated that about 20{\%} of the RF energy introduced into the vacuum vessel was converted into poloidal magnetic field energy, LI2/2, where L ≅ 3 $\mu$H is the total inductance of the plasma current loop. This conversion ratio should depend on a variety of factors, including the percentage of RF power absorbed by resonant electrons and the magnitude of the back current induced by the changing poloidal flux LI. The high ramp-up efficiencies are predicted theoretically in the regime in which the PLT ramp-up experiments operate, i.e., where the phase velocity of the waves is approximately equal in magnitude to the runaway velocity due to the back voltage. Comparison of the raw data with theory suggest that about ½ to ¾ of the incident RF power is absorbed by resonant high-velocity electrons.},
