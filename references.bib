	abstract = {When radio-frequency waves propagate through magnetized plasmas, they scatter at density filaments, which are usually aligned with the magnetic field lines. We show that this scattering can redirect part of the power from the perpendicular direction to the parallel direction (along the field lines, along the filament). In magnetic confinement fusion devices, such as tokamaks, plasma is often heated by Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequency (ICRF) antennas. For such antennas, our simulations show that a parallel Poynting flux in the level of 1 MW/m2 can be generated by this power redirection mechanism. The increase of the magnitude of electric and magnetic fields of the wave in the filament is responsible for the parallel redirection of power flow. Simulations with constant density in the filament and background plasma show that the dominant parallel wavenumbers of the power spectrum in the filament are increased and additional wavenumbers can be generated. In the cases with an experimental density profile, only the power spectrum in the filament is significantly affected while the rest part is almost the same.},

The simulation result carried out by CST microwave studio shows that the return loss reaches -64 dB at 4.6 GHz, and the power loss density was fitted by Origin software to calculate the thermal distribution of the Teflon and the water. Besides, the thermal analysis carried out by ANSYS indicates that this water load can work under 5 kW CW, with the maximum temperature of Teflon less than 71 ℃, and the maximum thermal deformation and stress are no more than 0.14 mm and 3.2 MPa.},

	abstract = {The effects of synthetic turbulence on lower hybrid (LH) wave field magnitude and polarization are studied on Alcator C-Mod. Three synthetic turbulence models are evaluated to assess the impact of filaments, holes, and periodic fluctuations on the LH wave electric fields. For all three cases, the synthetic turbulence can greatly impact the LH wave magnitude and polarization. Back scattering, interference and edge/SOL absorption of the LH wave is observed. This impact is shown to depend on the wavelength and amplitude of the fluctuations. The strongest effect appears for fluctuations at high amplitudes and wavelengths comparable to the LH wavelength. This synthetic turbulence model can be used as inputs into a synthetic diagnostic to calculate the lower hybrid wave field magnitude and direction measured by dynamic Stark effect spectroscopy. It will be shown that fluctuations at these high amplitudes and wavelengths may explain the experimentally measured results. The effect of fluctuations on modifying LH polarization are also shown to be anti-correlated with SOL power losses, similar to recently observed experimental trends on Alcator C-Mod. These SOL losses may have detrimental impact on LHCD efficiency.},

In this work, a systematic study of measured fusion cross-sections is performed to determine which reactions are potentially feasible and identify the fuel cycle that maximizes speciﬁc energy. This reveals that, by using normal hydrogen to breed deuterium via neutron capture, the conventional catalyzed D-D fusion fuel cycle can attain a speciﬁc energy greater than anything else. Simply surrounding a catalyzed D-D reactor with water enables deuterium fuel, the dominant stockpile of energy on Earth, to produce as much as 65\% more energy. Lastly, the impact on space propulsion is considered, revealing that an eﬀective exhaust velocity exceeding that of deuterium-helium-3 is theoretically possible.},

ELM mitigation by pellet ELM pacemaking or magnetic perturbation coils reduces the deposited energy during ELMs, but also keeps the W density at the pedestal low. As a recipe to keep the central W concentration sufficiently low, central (wave) heating is well established and low density H-Modes could be re-established with the newly available ECRH power of up to 4MW. The ICRH induced W sources could be strongly reduced by applying boron coatings to the poloidal guard limiters.},

Outgassing source during the RF conditioning is identified mainly as water vapor. A new dimensionless figure-of-merit to evaluate degree of the RF conditioning is defined with dissipated power and outgassing rate by analyzing experimentally observed RF conditioning data. Optimum performance of the antenna with low figure-of-merit (5 × 10−9) is achieved after conditioning for 3 days a week (∼40 shots) at less than 10 kW of input power. Coefficients of transmission, reflection, and dissipation reach to about 80\%, 2\%, and 18\%, respectively indicating almost doubled antenna performance.

	abstract = {A prototype of ICRF antenna matching system tolerant to fast plasma loading perturbations has been successfully tested at JET. The technique is based on the use of an external (outside the tokamak vacuum vessel) conjugate-T circuit tuned to low resistive impedance by coaxial line-stretchers (trombones). Further impedance transformation, required to complete the entire circuit matching is achieved by a conventional variable stub and trombone tuner. The experimental set-up involved one pair of adjacent straps of the JET A2 antenna array powered by a single RF amplifier. The tests fully confirmed the feasibility of the matching scheme both for vacuum and plasma loading. Clear evidence of high load-tolerance during plasma sawtooth oscillations and Edge Localised Modes (ELMs) was observed in agreement with the circuit simulations. Reliable trip-free performance was demonstrated in the 32–51MHz frequency band at ≤1MW power levels. The proposed approach appears as a viable alternative to the in-vessel conjugate-T matching schemes and offers such additional advantages as full compatibility with coaxial transmission line technology, manageable tuning accuracy, separation of launching and matching sub-systems and capability to conjugate remote antenna straps.},

	abstract = {The literature describing scattering matrices for semianalytical methods almost exclusively contains ineﬃcient formulations and formulations that deviate from long-standing convention in terms of how the scattering parameters are deﬁned. This paper presents a novel and highly improved formulation of scattering matrices that is consistent with convention, more eﬃcient to implement, and more versatile than what has been otherwise presented in the literature. Semi-analytical methods represent a device as a stack of layers that are uniform in the longitudinal direction. Scattering matrices are calculated for each layer and are combined into a single overall scattering matrix that describes propagation through the entire device. Free space gaps with zero thickness are inserted between the layers and the scattering matrices are made to relate ﬁelds which exist outside of the layers, but directly on their boundaries. This framework produces symmetric scattering matrices so only two parameters need to be calculated and stored instead of four. It also enables the scattering matrices to be arbitrarily interchanged and reused to describe longitudinally periodic devices more eﬃciently. Numerical results are presented that show speed and eﬃciency can be increased by more than an order of magnitude using the improved formulation.},

The new generation of linear tetrodes described operates at CW power levels up to 25 kW and meet two-tone single-sideband limits of better than -40 dB for third-order distortion products and better than -45 dB for fifth-order distortion products. These tetrodes perform in the 225-400-MHz military band and because of the good linearity are used in the new generation VHF television transmitters being introduced in the USA. Methods of designing circuits are discussed. Recently developed tetrodes operating at power levels up to 500kW atpower gains of 25-27 dBat 1MHz arealso described.

This cylinder is connected on either side to a circular waveguide and a rectangular waveguide section respectively, through tapered waveguide sections. In this analysis we used a perturbation technique where the rectangular waveguide section’s wall radius is treated as a Fourier series expansion with a, the fundamental radius and the perturbation parameter.

	abstract = {The calculus of differential forms has signiﬁcant advantages over traditional methods as a tool for teaching electromagnetic (EM) ﬁeld theory: First, forms clarify the relationship between ﬁeld intensity and ﬂux density, by providing distinct mathematical and graphical representations for the two types of ﬁelds. Second, Ampere’s and Faraday’s laws obtain graphical representations that are as intuitive as the representation of Gauss’s law. Third, the vector Stokes theorem and the divergence theorem become special cases of a single relationship that is easier for the student to remember, apply, and visualize than their vector formulations. Fourth, computational simpliﬁcations result from the use of forms: derivatives are easier to employ in curvilinear coordinates, integration becomes more straightforward, and families of vector identities are replaced by algebraic rules. In this paper, EM theory and the calculus of differential forms are developed in parallel, from an elementary, conceptually oriented point of view using simple examples and intuitive motivations. We conclude that because of the power of the calculus of differential forms in conveying the fundamental concepts of EM theory, it provides an attractive and viable alternative to the use of vector analysis in teaching electromagnetic ﬁeld theory.},

	abstract = {The exterior calculus of diﬀerential forms provides a mathematical framework for electromagnetic ﬁeld theory that combines much of the generality of tensor analysis with the computational simplicity and concreteness of the vector calculus. We review the pedagogical aspects of the calculus of diﬀerential forms in providing distinct representations of ﬁeld intensity and ﬂux density, physically meaningful graphical representations for sources, ﬁelds, and ﬂuxes, and a picture of the curl operation that is as simple and intuitive as that of the gradient and divergence. To further highlight the beneﬁts of diﬀerential forms notation, we demonstrate the ﬂexibility of the calculus of diﬀerential forms in responding to changes in the dimensionality of the underlying manifold on which the calculus is deﬁned. We develop Maxwell’s equations in the case of two space dimensions with time (2+1), and in a four-dimensional (4D or spacetime) representation with time included as a diﬀerential basis element on an equal footing with the spatial dimensions. The 2+1 case is commonly treated in textbooks using component notation, but we show that Maxwell’s equations and the theorems and principles of electromagnetics can be expressed in a fundamentally two-dimensional formulation. In the 4D representation, graphical representations can be given to illustrate four-dimensional ﬁelds in a way that provides intuition into the interplay between the electric and magnetic ﬁelds in wave propagation. These results illustrate the usefulness of diﬀerential forms in providing the physical insight required for engineering applications of electromagnetics.},

In each domain higher-order modes provide the accurate local description of the electromagnetic ﬁelds while lower-order modes are used to model the electromagnetic coupling between the various domains at large scales. The scale changing technique is applied here to the electromagnetic modeling of multifrequency selective surfaces and discrete self-similar (pre-fractal) scatterers. Experimental data are given for validation purpose. It is seen that the proposed technique is much better than the method of moments in time costing.},

	abstract = {Electron cyclotron heating (ECH) is one of the main candidates for heating and current drive on ITER (170 GHz) and W7-X (140 GHz). High unit power (1 MW or greater) and high efficiency single-mode continuous-wave (CW) gyrotrons are under development in order to reduce significantly the systems costs. Face-cooled double-disk sapphire and silicon nitride windows (FC-75 liquid cooling), cryogenically edgecooled single-disk sapphire (liquid nitrogen, liquid neon or liquid helium cooling) and silicon (230 K refrigerator cooling) windows, water-edgecooled single-disk CVD-diamond windows and water-cooled distributed windows are being investigated in order to solve the window problem. A water-cooled window has two very important advantages; it employs a cheap and effective coolant and it is compact and probably more reliable than other solutions and thus can also be easily used as a torus window. The present paper summarizes the development status of high-power millimeter-wave windows with emphasis on CVD diamond.},

	abstract = {Two-step high-power TEO3-to-TE01 mode transducers (TE02 is the intermediate mode) were designed to transform the TE03 output mode of the 150 GHz KfK gyrotron into the fundamental circular symmetric TE01 mode for low-loss propagation and further conversion into the linearly polarized quasioptical HEll mode. The advanced perturbation structures of the rippled-wall mode converters (with input- and outputdiameter D = 27.8 mm) were optimized by numerically solving the proper coupled-wave differential equations. The overall TE03-to-TE01 conversion efficiency at 150 GHz was calculated to be no = 99.1\% for a long converter (total length L = 2.67 m) and qO = 97.8\% for a short converter (L = 1.07 m); ohmic attenuation is included. The corresponding theoretical bandwidth (for n {\textasciitilde} 9 5 \% ) i s • GHz and • GHz, respectively. Low-power experimental data are in excellent agreement with these computed values.},

The paper reports on high-power components for overmoded high-power transmission systems such as smooth-wall waveguides, HE11 hybrid mode waveguides and quasi-optical TEM00 beam waveguides. These include various types of mode converters, polarizers, cross-section tapers, bends, mode selective filters, pulse compressors, DC-breaks, directional couplers, beam combiners and dividers, vacuum windows, and instruments for mode analysis. Problems of ohmic attenuation and unwanted conversion to parasitic modes are discussed in detail and rules for alignment requirements are given. In the case of waveguide transmission, this review mainly concentrates on circular waveguide components but also deals with rectangular waveguide.},

The GA is employed to optimize the choice of geometrical parameters by minimizing a cost function, corresponding to the maximum magnitude of the reﬂection coeﬃcient in the band. The selection of the most relevant parameters allowed an improvement of the performances for the optimized components. Results of optimization are given for both two and four-section transformers.},

The scattering parameters of an port cannot be measured directly with a two-port VNA if 2. Only the scattering parameters of all two-port combinations of the device-under-test (DUT) are measurable. Thereby, the measured two-port scattering parameters strongly depend on the external terminations of the DUTs ports, which are not connected to the VNA during the measurements. In order to eliminate the inﬂuences of these external possibly reﬂective terminations, an error correction has to be performed. In comparison to known correction methods, the multiport method has some advantages. Firstly, the external terminations can be chosen arbitrarily, i.e., short and open circuits are realizable as long as the topology of the DUT allows it. Secondly, the terminations, except for one, can be unknown, leading to a reduction of the inconsistency problem caused by erroneous data of the external terminations, which is also known from the calibration of VNAs with completely known calibration standards. The good performance of the multiport method is shown by measured results.},

The PE-computed ﬁelds at h are then projected onto a complete Gabor basis from which we effect Gaussian beam propagation at altitudes greater than h. The Gaussian beams can be propagated through general inhomogeneous media, devoid of failures at caustics and shadow boundaries (as befalls ray tracing). The accuracy of the Gaussian beam algorithm is demonstrated via two realistic examples: 1) low-frequency (HF) ionospheric propagation with application to over-the-horizon radar and 2) near-grazing high-frequency propagation for communication or surveillance applications. In the context of these examples, we discuss relevant numerical issues associated with the hybrid algorithm from which general advantages and disadvantages are addressed.},

	abstract = {The short interconnect length between the LHC superconducting magnets required the development of an optimised RF shielded bellows module, with a low impedance combined with compensation for large thermal displacements and alignment lateral offsets. Each bellows is shielded by slender copper-beryllium fingers working as pre-loaded beams in order to provide a constant force at the sliding contact. Unless the sliding friction and some geometrical parameters of the fingers are kept within a limited range, a large irreversible lateral deflection towards the vacuum chamber axis may occur and eventually block the beam aperture. The finite element analysis presented here simulates this failure mechanism, providing a complete understanding of the finger behaviour as well as the influence of the various design parameters. An implicit non-linear two-dimensional model integrating friction on the sliding contacts, geometrical non-linearity and plasticity was implemented in a first stage. The design was then verified through the whole working range using an explicit formulation, which overcame the instabilities resulting from the sudden release of internal energy stored in the finger.},

All design features and manufacture processes were validated through extensive testing. Manufacture and assembly cost was minimised by using a modular interconnect design, with common components shared among different design variants. A detailed quality assurance structure was implemented in order to achieve the high level of reliability required.

In particular, the underlying coordinate-stretching idea behind PML breaks down in photonic crystals and in other structures where the material is not an analytic function in the direction perpendicular to the boundary, leading to substantial reﬂections. The alternative is an adiabatic absorber, in which reﬂections are made negligible by gradually increasing the material absorption at the boundaries, similar to a common strategy to combat discretization reﬂections in PMLs. We demonstrate the fundamental connection between such reﬂections and the smoothness of the absorption proﬁle via coupled-mode theory, and show how to obtain higher-order and even exponential vanishing of the reﬂection with absorber thickness (although further work remains in optimizing the constant factor).},

Staras proposed the second one. In this paper, we offer an analytical solution for the second one as proposed by Staras. We compare both distributions and find that impedances resulting from them are remarkably close. We conclude that the impedance of a short antenna, as derived using the quasi-static approximation, is insensitive to the choice of current distribution. Therefore, any of these two theories can be used when analyzing data from an impedance probe immersed in a space plasma.},

The internal region is further segmented into several blocks, connected to each other via their generalized admittance matrices (GAMs). The latter are calculated by means of either a commercial or a home made tool. The front plate is considered as a whole and analyzed by the moment method, in terms of modes of the slots. The latter are considered as short sections of waveguide whose length is just the conductor thickness, connecting the internal and external regions.

	abstract = {In RF cold plasma reactors, energy transfer from the generator to the discharge is not perfect and only 50 to 70 percent (or even less) of the power is eﬀectively transmitted to the discharge, the remaining part being mostly dissipated in the matching network. The choice of this circuit is therefore the most important factor in view to optimize the energy transfer from the power supply to the plasma. Two classical networks, Π- and L-type, are analytically studied in their interaction with the experimental device. From this study, in both cases, numerical values are deduced for the coil inductance, and a capacitance range is determined for the capacitors. An experimental study in argon plasma at pressure range of 40200 mTorr and at 13.56 MHz, performed with the two types of matching networks leads to a much eﬀective energy transfer with the L-type, which must be chosen in order to improve the energetic yield of surface processing (sputtering or etching for instance) with a RF plasma reactor.},

	title = {{DIMOHA}: an advanced algorithm for complete traveling-wave tube simulations},
	abstract = {To simulate traveling-wave tubes (TWTs) in time domain and more generally the wave-particle interaction in vacuum devices, we developed DIMOHA as an alternative to current particle-in-cell (PIC) and frequency approaches. Indeed, it is based on a longitudinal N -body Hamiltonian approach satisfying Maxwell’s equations. Advantages of DIMOHA include: (i) it allows arbitrary waveform (not just ﬁeld envelope), including continuous waveform (CW), multiple carriers or digital modulations (shift keying); (ii) the algorithm is much faster than PIC codes thanks to a ﬁeld discretization allowing a drastic degree-of-freedom reduction, along with a robust symplectic integrator; (iii) it supports any periodic slow-wave structure design such as helix or folded waveguides; (iv) it reproduces harmonic generation, reﬂection, oscillation and distortion phenomena; (v) it handles nonlinear dynamics, including intermodulations, trapping and chaos. DIMOHA accuracy is assessed by comparing it against measurements from a commercial Ku-band tapered helix TWT and against simulations from a sub-THz folded waveguide TWT with a staggered double-grating slow-wave structure (SWS). The algorithm is also tested near band edges and for multiple-carriers simulations, both with success.},

To assess its validity, we compare it in a small-signal regime with Pierce’s four-wave theory. For both models, we take the same simpliﬁed ﬂuid model and we express the associated circuit-beam impedances. We show analytically and with a numerical example that the newly developed reduced model is very close to the Pierce model, especially where the latter is well established. Small deviations do occur at the edges of the ampliﬁcation band, where Pierce’s model is known to lose its accuracy while the reduced model offers a valid physical interpretation.},

	abstract = {The yellow-legged Asian hornet is an invasive species of wasps, indigenous to the Southeast Asia but recently spreading in Southern Europe. Because of its exponential diffusion and its serious threat to the local honeybee colonies (and to humans as well), restraint measures are currently under investigation. We developed and tested an harmonic radar capable of tracking the ﬂying trajectory of these insects, once equipped with a small transponder, in their natural environment. Several hornets were captured close to a small cluster of honeybee hives, tagged with different transponders and then released in order to follow the ﬂight toward their nest. On-ﬁeld testing proved an initial maximum detection range of about 125 m in a hilly and woody area. A number of detections were clearly recorded, and preferential directions of ﬂight were identiﬁed. The system herein described is intended as a ﬁrst low-cost harmonic radar; it proved the capability to track the hornets while ﬂying and it permitted to test the tagging techniques. Several upgrades of the system have been identiﬁed during this work and are extensively described in the last chapter. The designed system has three major advantages over conventional harmonic radars. First and most importantly, it adopts advanced processing techniques to suppress clutter and to improve target detection. Second, it allows radar operations in complex environments, generally hilly and rich in vegetation. Finally, it can continuously track tagged insects (24/7) and in any meteorological condition, providing an effective tool in order to locate the nests of the yellow-legged Asian hornet.},

This program allows for very detailed geometries of the radiating structures, but was only considering simple materials like equivalent isotropic dielectrics to simulate the reﬂection and the refraction of RF waves at the vacuum/plasma interface. The code was nevertheless used intensively, notably for computing the coupling properties of the ITER ICRF antenna. Until recently it was not possible to simulate gyrotropic medias like magnetized plasmas, but recent improvements have allowed programming any material described by a general dielectric or/and diamagnetic tensor. A Visual Basic macro was developed to exploit this feature and was tested for the speciﬁc case of a monochromatic plane wave propagating longitudinally with respect to the magnetic ﬁeld direction. For speciﬁc cases the exact solution can be expressed in 1D as the sum of two circularly polarized waves connected by a reﬂection coeﬃcient that can be analytically computed. Solutions for stratiﬁed media can also be derived. This allows for a direct comparison with MWS results. The agreement is excellent but accurate simulations for realistic geometries require large memory resources that could signiﬁcantly restrict the possibility of simulating cold plasmas to small-scale machines.},

Here, we show that general relativity provides the theoretical tools for designing devices made of such versatile materials. Given a desired device function, the theory describes the electromagnetic properties that turn this function into fact. We consider media that facilitate space-time transformations and include negative refraction. Our theory uniﬁes the concepts operating behind the scenes of perfect invisibility devices, perfect lenses, the optical Aharonov–Bohm effect and electromagnetic analogues of the event horizon, and may lead to further applications.},

	abstract = {Microwave discharges (MD) are widely used as a source of non-equilibrium low pressure plasma for different applications. This paper reviews the methods of microwave plasma generation at pressures from 10−2 approximately to 30 kPa with centimeter–millimeter wavelength microwaves on the basis of scientific publications since 1950 up to the present. The review consists of 16 sections. A general look at MDs and their application is given in the introduction, together with a description of a typical block-schema of the microwave plasma generator, classification of MD, and attractive features of MD. Sections 2–12 describe the different methods of microwave plasma generators on the basis of cavity and waveguide discharges, surface and slow wave discharges, discharges with distributed energy input, initiated and surface discharges, discharges in wave beams, discharges with stochastically jumping phases of microwaves, discharges in an external magnetic field and discharges with a combination of microwave field and dc and RF fields. These methods provide the possibility of producing nonequilibriun high density plasma in small and large chambers for many applications. Plasma chemical activity of nonequilibrium microwave plasma is analyzed in section 13. A short consideration of the history and status of the problem is given. The main areas of microwave plasma application are briefly described in section 14. Non-uniformity is the inherent property of the majority of electrical discharges and MDs are no exception. Peculiarities of physical–chemical processes in strongly non-uniform MDs are demonstrated placing high emphasis on the influence of small noble gas additions to the main plasma gas (section 15). The review is illustrated by 80 figures. The list of references contains 350 scientific publications.},

All designs operate at a central frequency of 17.136 GHz and convert circular electric modes (TE0 ) from one radial mode to the next higher mode. The emphasis of the design study is to maximize the bandwidth of the device without sacriﬁcing mode purity. Mode converters from the TE01 to TE02 mode and from the TE02 to TE03 mode were investigated in depth, and two designs, each with six periods, were constructed and tested. The nonuniform ripple seems to have a signiﬁcant advantage over the constant ripple design for the higher mode converter, while the designs for the lower mode converter are comparable. Experimental measurements agree well with the theoretical results both in terms of bandwidth and mode content.},

Proper pole handling is discussed, and a solution for the system is given. Expressions are derived for the reﬂected, transmitted, and radiated power, which are shown to be sufﬁciently reliable in the domain of practical interest, regarding the width and the dielectric loading of the gap. The analysis shows that a substantial fraction of the microwave power leaks from the dielectric gap, conﬁrming the absolute necessity of using a choke-ﬂange at the waveguide junction.},

The expansion utilizes an edge-ﬁxed lattice of expansion beams, involving a phase-space beam expansion along the edge and an angular spectrum of beam around the edge. The excitation amplitudes of the diffracted beams, deﬁned as the beam to beam (B2B) scattering matrix, are derived, interpreted, and validated via a comparison with an exact numerical solution. The representation is valid uniformly as a function of the incident beam direction and its distance from the edge. The asymptotic limits when the beam impinges far from the edge are interpreted via the geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD). The general procedure for calculating the B2B scattering coefﬁcients may be applied for other wedge-type conﬁgurations. The new formulation enables the construction of self-consistent Gaussian beams summation (GBS) representations in complex conﬁgurations, in which the ﬁeld is described as a sum of beam propagators, and the diffracted ﬁelds due to the propagators that hit near edges are also expanded in terms of beams. Applications to GBS modeling of urban propagation are discussed.},

For the idealized case of a wedge-shaped geometry, it is shown that only under certain physical circumstances does the singularity and the concomitant strongly enhanced microwave ﬁeld determine the breakdown strength. In particular, when diffusion is the dominating loss mechanism for the electron density, breakdown is a volumetric process, and the ﬁeld singularity does not determine the breakdown threshold. In such situations, excessive accuracy in numerical calculations is not required. Conditions for volumetric and localized breakdown, respectively, are established analytically, and the validity is demonstrated by numerical simulations. Finally, the analysis is extrapolated and compared with experimentally observed breakdown thresholds in commercially available resonators of nonidealized geometry. Good agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental results is demonstrated.},

Recent approaches based on Gaussian beams for tracking ﬁelds may overcome some problems inherent to the ray methods such as caustics. The eﬃciency of these methods is based on the ability to expand surface ﬁelds into a superposition of gaussian beams. However, some diﬃculties may arise when the surface is curved. In this paper, we propose a new eﬃcient way to expand ﬁelds on a curved surface into gaussian beams. For this purpose, a new beam formulation called Conformal Gaussian Beam (CGB) is used. The CGBs have been developed to overcome the limitation of the expansion into paraxial Gaussian Beams. The analytical Plane-Wave Spectrum and far-ﬁeld of a CGB are derived and compared with numerical calculations. A brief parameter analysis of the CGBs is realised.},

From the point-of-view of design and manufacturing this coupler geometry is attractive since it does not require capacitive loading. This comes at the expense of bandwidth: measured results show that over a 6.5\% bandwidth 0.125-dB power equality, 30 dB isolation and 1.07 VSWR is achieved for a coupler of length 1.25 . Although this is less than the 15\% achieved for capacitively-loaded couplers it is sufficient for many applications and the simplicity of the geometry makes it an attractive option in narrowband designs.

The fields inside the FWG unit are approximated in the model of the usual rectangular waveguide that will result from unfolding the FWG, keeping the corresponding dimensions. Including the surface impedance for a hot reactor sized plasma and the external current simulating the short probe source inside the waveguide allows one to investigate the coupling between units, the input impedance and the matching of a system consisting of several FWG units. Reconstructing the field structure both inside the waveguides and in the vacuum layer (between the coupler front and the plasma), the poloidal and toroidal spectra of the waves launched into the plasma are computed in the case where the effect of the poloidal magnetic field is neglected. Assuming 60 MHz frequency and specific ITER relevant waveguide and plasma parameters with 5 cm scrape-off decay length and 10 cm vacuum gap between the plasma and the waveguide, the present model with idealized non-perturbed feeder excitation predicts a voltage of less than 40 kV along the current probe source, a maximum electric field below 30 kV'cm-l and a maximum voltage of the order of 250 kV inside the FWG with ten folds for 10 MW radiated power per unit. For a waveguide complex composed of eight units, the mutual coupling between the units is found to be non-negligible, indicating a need for tuning in the system circuit.},

Fields in the varying waveguide sections are expanded as a sum of the modes of the locally straight waveguide, which, as a result of the longitudinal variations, are coupled to each other; the coupling coefﬁcients depend on the transition geometry and are easily evaluated analytically. The technique offers considerable efﬁciency and is particularly suitable for the CAD of a large class of waveguide components like tapers, mitered bends, transitions, etc. Examples of applications and comparisons with reference data are illustrated for the case of H-plane transitions in rectangular waveguides. ᮊ 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

In this paper, an automatic antenna tuner system for handheld applications is presented that uses two series reactances combined with three simple RF peak detectors to sense both reactive and real impedance mismatches. The control loop only requires low-frequency electronics which makes it low cost, low power and relatively easy to integrate.

	abstract = {At high average power level, waveguide-based structures are indispensable in microwave systems due to their higher power handling capacity. These structures are often used to perform power division and combination operation. Folded H plane tee is one of the many components that can be used for the power division application. Its advantage is that the output arms and input arms are in a single plane along a single axis, thus taking less space in the overall system. However, their proper thermal management is indispensable for its use, as high surface temperature of the waveguide reduces its power handling capacity at high power level. This paper presents quick, easy design steps and methodology for obtaining the structure of a folded H plane tee at any given frequency of operation. Further, a scheme for the thermal management for high input power level (500 kW continuous wave) is presented. The proposed methodology is tested at various frequencies in COMSOL Multiphysics, CST Microwave Studio and HFSS with excellent results. A prototype structure was fabricated for use at 3.7 GHz, which exhibited good agreement with the simulation results.},

One includes a simplified version of the generic tuner, which can achieve good matching levels between the antenna and the power module with low losses. In a more complete version, an application specific integrated circuit control unit is developed including a complex search algorithm. In order to obtain a good matching level, both systems require a control module to select the proper tuner impedance configuration. The measurements and results of both constructed prototypes are presented.

A controller measures the reflected RF signal and adjusts the settings of components in the matching circuit. The system is highly nonlinear and there are significant sources of uncertainty in the model of the process. A variable structure controller is designed and its stability is examined in the presence of uncertainties due to stray components. The switching lines are defined in terms of the real and imaginary parts of the reflected signal, which avoids the need to estimate the states. Conditions are derived for maintaining stability in the region close to the matching point. The performance of the controller is illustrated by results from an implementation on a prototype commercial RF oven.},

Special attention is given to the type of wave that has only one transverse and everywhere parallel component of electric intensity, and the results of experiments on this wave are reported. Expressions for the attenuation of the different types of waves allow comparisons to be made with corresponding waves in a pipe of circular cross section. In a rectangular pipe, no wave has been found whose attenuation decreases indefinitely as the frequency is increased, as does the Ho uwave in a circular pipe.},

	abstract = {A highly efficient Guassian beam (GB) method was recently developed to provide a relatively rapid analysis of large reflector antennas. This GB method is very efficient because it represents the feed radiation in terms of a set of very few rotationally symmetric GBs and provides an essentially closed form solution for the reflection and diffraction of each GB incidence on the reflector surface. In contrast, conventional approaches evaluate the radiated field via a numerical integration of the physical optics integral over the large reflector surface; such numerical techniques are time consuming for large reflectors. However, the fast GB method becomes less accurate if each GB illuminating spot on the reflecting surface is comparable to the overall reflector size, since its closed-form solution requires a small spot size. This liinitation of the GB approach happens particularly in situations where the feed is located relatively far from the reflector, since the GBs are not able to remain narrow in the angular and spatial domains simultaneously,thereby creating too large a spot size on the reflector surface. The above limitation of the GBs is overcome here by introducing a Gaussian-ray basis fhction (GRBF), a hybridisation of a geometrical optics (GO) ray tube and a GB. Owing to its similarity with a GB in the amplitude variation transverse to the ray, its incorporation into any existing GB code is straightforward. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the new GRBF approach.},

The Faraday shielding eﬀect depends upon the wires having ﬁnite radius and is weaker than one might expect, scaling as {\textbar} log r{\textbar}/n in an appropriate regime of small r and large n. Both numerical results and a mathematical theorem are provided. By the method of multiple scales, a continuum approximation is then derived in the form of a homogenized boundary condition for the Laplace equation along a curve. The homogenized equation reveals that in a Faraday cage, charge moves so as to somewhat cancel an external ﬁeld, but not enough for the cancellation to be fully eﬀective. Physically, the eﬀect is one of electrostatic induction in a surface of limited capacitance. An alternative discrete model of the eﬀect is also derived based on a principle of energy minimization. Extensions to electromagnetic waves and 3D geometries are mentioned.},

Based on the algorithm of the generalized cascade scattering matrix, a useful derivation on the excitation coefficients of antenna arrays is firstly proposed with consideration of the coupling effects. And then, the proposed techniques are applied on the microwave circuits and antenna arrays. Firstly, an improved magic-T is optimized, fabricated, and measured. Compared with the existing results, the prototype has a wider bandwidth, lower insertion loss, better return loss, isolation, and imbalances. Secondly, two typical linear waveguide slotted arrays are designed. Both the radiation patterns and scattering parameters at the input ports agree well with the desired goals. Finally, the feeding network of a two-element microstrip antenna array is optimized to decrease the mismatch at the input port, and a good impedance matching is successfully achieved.},

Both measurements indicate that, on the average, about a fraction of 1\% of the incident power is absorbed by the thin films, even though the local absorption coefficient may reach 50\%. Discontinuous surface films, where the surface contaminants have a patchy or island structure, are modeled with an equivalent transmission line circuit.

	abstract = {This work deals with the stability of Perfectly Matched Layers (PMLs). The ﬁrst part is a survey of previous results about the classical PMLs in non-dispersive media (construction and necessary condition of stability). The second part concerns some extensions of these results. We give a new necessary criterion of stability valid for a large class of dispersive models and for more general PMLs than the classical ones. This criterion is applied to two dispersive models: negative index metamaterials and uniaxial anisotropic plasmas. In both cases, classical PMLs are unstable but the criterion allows us to design new stable PMLs. Numerical simulations illustrate our purpose.},

The survey begins with a review of work on natural and man made sources of ELF and VLF radiation. This is followed by sections on experimental and theoretical studies of unperturbed (ambient) ELF and VLF radio propagation. Schumann resonance research, which is currently undergoing a renaissance, is then reviewed. A review of research into transient perturbations of ELF and VLF propagation follows, extending from the early work on nuclear explosions up to the current work on sprites. The review concludes with a brief summary of the VLF navigation systems of the USSR and USA, (Alpha and Omega) whose development and life-span covered most of the last 50 years. c 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In this procedure, screens of large extent with complex but periodic geometry are replaced during the FEM simulation by sheets representing anisotropic impedance boundary conditions. The homogenized anisotropic impedance boundary conditions are calculated from a single unit cell of the screen by using the finite element method. The FEM is modified to handle the new anisotropic impedance boundary condition. Replacing large screens with an impedance boundary condition reduces the size of the finite element mesh and allows more complex structures to be simulated. While the procedure is approximate, it does provide good accuracy to determine levels of EMC/EMI radiation in complex electronic equipment. The method is applied to compute the radiation emanating from a real-life electronic printed circuit board enclosed in a real-life computer cabinet.},

	abstract = {The last five years have witnessed remarkable progress in the theory and measurement of both the radiation and impedance properties of antennas in plasmas. Increased motivation for research in this area has been provided by the Space Shuttle program and by the prospect of nuclear fusion. The focus of attention has been on resonance cones" in linear, anisotropic plasmas, including radiation patterns, wave interference, pulse propagation, reflections from boundaries and inhomogeneous media effects. Under nonlinear conditions, the focussed field of a resonance cone can significantly depress the plasma density. Under both linear and nonlinear conditions, the input impedance of dipole and loop antennas has been studied extensively, for both anisotropic and isotropic plasmas. A continuing challenge has been the as-yet-not-fully-explained experimental observation of linear, non-eollisional enhanced resistivity of the sheath region around an antenna. Numerical impedance calculations employing simplified velocity distributions have shown particular promise. Ion and electron wave radiation patterns for various antenna shapes have been calculated and checked experimentally. The response of both single antennas and pairs of antennas to plasma fluctuations has been studied and found to have applications to plasma diagnostics.},

Excited by a single-frequency point source, this metamaterial exhibits conical high-field regions called “resonance cones” which extend outward from the source in directions predetermined by the load reactances, thus carrying RF power to specific points on the resistively terminated network edges. When two such metamaterials are interfaced, the cones traversing the interface can exhibit negative refraction as well as subwavelength focusing, phenomena supported by physical experiments and corresponding moment-method simulations. Poynting vector calculations based on the simulation data reveal power flow that follows the cones smoothly from the source and across the refraction interface. Electromagnetic field and Poynting vector calculations both exhibit potentially significant differences depending on whether they are done at the ground plane level or at the level of the anisotropic grid.},

	abstract = {An overmoded rectangular waveguide system which operates in the vicinity of 30 GHz is used to investigate multimode propagation problems. By careful design of the input waveguide either a relatively pure TElO or a combination of TE10 and higher modes may be launched into a 3 m long overmoded test section of the system. The overmoded section is terminated in a matched load. The wavaguide will support T E {\textasciitilde} mO odes where n is any odd integer between 1 and 13. Even-order modes are normally suppressed, if they arise at all, by a longitudinal slot along the centre of one of the broad faces of the waveguide. Electric field amplitude and phase profiles within the overmoded waveguide are measured continuously, either transversely or longitudinally. The mathematical techniques required to determine higher-order mode content from the field profiles within the waveguide are considered. The ill-conditioning problems that arise when an attempt is made to solve conventionally a system of linear simultaneous equations are avoided by using a Fourier technique. By considering a simple launching profile such as an abrupt boundary enlargement, the higher-order mode content of the waveguide is calculated. Experimental measurements of the field within the waveguide enable mode content to be determined for comparison with the theoretical data. In this way the amplitudes and phases of the higher-order propagating modes are determined.},

By using CGA, fundamental network operations, such as adding impedance, admittance, and changing lines impedance can be implemented with rotations, and are shown to form a group. In addition, the transformations relating different circuit representations, such as impedance, admittance, and reﬂection coefﬁcient are also related by rotations. Thus, the majority of relationships in transmission line theory are linearized. Conventional transmission line formulas are replaced with an operator-based framework. Use of the framework is demonstrated by analyzing the distributed element model and solving some impedance matching problems.},

These coupling elements enable low-cost manufacturing, since accurate and inexpensive metal-etching techniques, or materials with standard dimensions may be utilised. The design method is based on field expansion in suitably normalised eigenmodes which yield directly the modal scattering matrix of two appropriate key building blocks for this kind of filter, the step-wall discontinuity and the N-furcated waveguide section of finite length. The theory includes the finite thickness of the diaphragms, strips or posts as well as the immediate higher-order mode interaction of all discontinuities. The stop-band characteristic of the filter is taken into account in the optimisation process. Optimised data are given for Ku-, E-, W-, and D-band filter examples, whereby it is shown that the theory is also very appropriate for broadband designs. The theory is verified by measured results for a six resonator iris coupled Ku-band filter, with a midband frequency of 15.2 GHz and a seven-resonator metal insert D-band filter, with a midband frequency of 142.5 GHz, snowing measured minimum insertion losses of 0.2 dB and 1.4 dB, respectively.},

	abstract = {The International Tokamak Physics Activity topical group on integrated operational scenarios has compiled a database of stationary H-mode discharges at q 95 3 from AUG, C-Mod, DIII-D, JET and JT-60U, for both carbon wall and high-Z metal wall experiments with 3300 entries. The analyses focus on discharges that are stationary for ⩾5 thermal energy confinement times to evaluate the baseline scenario proposed for ITER at 15 MA for achieving its goals of Q = 10, fusion power of 500 MW at normalised pressure, β N = 1.8 and normalised confinement as predicted by the standard H-mode scaling, H 98y2 = 1. With the data restricted to stationary H-modes at q 95 3, the database shows significant variation of thermal energy confinement compared to the standard H-mode scaling (IPB98(y,2)) in dimensionless form. The data show similar scaling with normalised gyro-radius, but more favourable scaling towards lower collision frequency and more favourable scaling with plasma beta. Using all the engineering variables employed in IPB98(y,2), results in an overfit due to correlations among the data. Moreover, there are significant residual trends in the confinement for plasma current, device size, loss power, and in particular for the plasma density. Significant differences between results obtained for devices with a carbon wall and high-Z metal wall are observed in the data, with data from carbon wall devices providing a larger operating space, encompassing ITER parameters or even exceeding them. H-modes in high-Z metal wall devices have, so-far, not accessed conditions at low collision frequencies, have lower normalised confinement (H 98y2 0.8–0.9) at low input power or beta, achieving H 98y2 1.0 only at input powers two times the L- to H-mode transition scaling predictions and at β N 2.0. Hence, only the best H-modes with high-Z metal walls reach ITER baseline performance requirements. The data show that operating at high plasma density, with line-averaged density at 85\% of Greenwald density is achievable for H 98y2 {\textgreater} 0.95 for a range of plasma configurations, and that operation at low plasma inductance with l i(3) 0.7–0.75 is feasible. Scenario simulations employed for projecting the plasma performance in ITER should incorporate a lower thermal confinement at low plasma beta for the entry to burn and provide projections using higher levels of plasma core radiation by plasma impurities. Moreover, ITER projections should not subtract the core radiation in the evaluation of the thermal confinement time and H 98y2, to allow a fair comparison with experimental data currently available. From the data presented here, it is likely that in ITER the energy confinement time will not increase with plasma density and will have no degradation with plasma beta. The analyses indicate that the data at q 95 3 are consistent with achievement of the ITER mission goals at 15 MA.},

Assuming prescribed geometrical coefficients, we find the ensemble of possible triplets R, B and normalized beta which allow one to reach target fusion gain Q and fusion power , at an arbitrary Greenwald fraction. The model is generic and derived for any scaling law of the energy confinement time. Using the IPB98(y,2) scaling law (ITER Physics Expert Group on Confinement and Transport and Confinement Modeling and Database and ITER Physics Basis Editors 1999 Nucl. Fusion 39 2175) leads to ITER specifications, as expected. The recently proposed new scaling law for H-mode plasmas (DS03, (Sips et al 2018 Nucl. Fusion 58 126010)) is shown to lead to modest changes to the dimensioning, except for B which could be significantly smaller for the same target performance. The impact on the dimensioning of critical exponents of the scaling law—both regarding engineer and dimensionless variables—is assessed, pushing for their determination with refined accuracy. Finally, the method is applied to a DEMO-like machine. The DS03 scaling law is found to have favorable consequences on the dimensioning as compared to IPB98(y,2), provided one is able to operate at larger , which can reveal challenging in a reactor aiming at zero disruption. Importantly, the opposite scaling of both scaling laws with respect to the aspect ratio are shown to have significant consequences on the optimal choice of this critical parameter.},

High RF power transmitters were designed as a part of the research and development (R\&D) for an ICRF system with long pulse operation at megawatt levels in a frequency range of 25 MHz to 70 MHz. Studies presented in this paper cover the following parts of the high power transmitter: the three staged high power ampliﬁer, which is composed of a 5 kW wideband solid state ampliﬁer, a 100 kW tetrode drive stage ampliﬁer and a 1.5 MW tetrode ﬁnal stage ampliﬁer, and the DC high voltage power supply (HVPS). Based on engineering design and static examinations, the RF transmitters were tested using a matched dummy load where an RF output power of 1.5 MW was achieved. The transmitters provide 6 MW RF power in primary phase and will reach a level up to 12 MW after a later upgrade. The transmitters performed successfully in stable operations in EAST and HT-7 devices. Up to 1.8 MW of RF power was injected into plasmas in EAST ICRF heating experiments during the 2010 autumn campaign and plasma performance was greatly improved.},

Large RF power is reﬂected in such transitions as that of ELMy H–L mode due to the large change in plasma resistance during the ICRF H \& CD. In such a case the RF power injection to the plasma must be ceased in order to protect the tetrode vacuum tubes. The idea of a complex-conjugate impedance antenna system to mitigate the large reﬂected RF power, referred to as ELM tolerance, has recently been proposed. It has been proved that the reﬂected RF power fraction can be reduced even during a large change in plasma resistance. But it is not reduced to the level allowable for the tetrode tubes. Therefore, an improved system adding a single stub tuner is proposed. Using it, the reﬂected RF power fraction can be reduced to the allowable level. Numerical calculations and experiments are carried out for this system. It is found that the experimental data agree with numerical calculations.},

A crucial aspect of coupling ICRF power to plasmas is the knowledge of the plasma density proﬁles in the Scrape-Off Layer (SOL) and the location of the RF current straps with respect to the SOL. The launcher layout and details were optimized and its performance estimated for a worst case SOL provided by the IO.

They must also perform ancillary functions, such as assisting plasma start-up and wall conditioning. It is recognized that no one system can satisfy all of these requirements with the degree of ﬂexibility that ITER will require. Four heating and current drive systems are therefore under consideration for ITER: electron cyclotron waves at a principal frequency of 170 GHz; fast waves operating in the range 40–70 MHz (ion cyclotron waves); lower hybrid waves at 5 GHz; and neutral beam injection using negative ion beam technology for operation at 1 MeV energy. It is likely that several of these systems will be employed in parallel. The systems have been chosen on the basis of the maturity of physics understanding and operating experience in current experiments and on the feasibility of applying the relevant technology to ITER. Here, the fundamental physics describing the interaction of these heating systems with the plasma is reviewed, the relevant experimental results in the exploitation of the heating and current drive capabilities of each system are discussed, key aspects of their application to ITER are outlined, and the major technological developments required in each area are summarized.},

	abstract = {There is a growing recognition that we need an alternative to conventional fossil fuels. Shortages of oil and gas have the potential to cause economic and political instability, and burning fossil fuels can cause environmental damage, as well as being the likeliest cause of global warming. Fusion—the process that powers the sun and stars, has the potential to provide large-scale, safe energy production, without adding to global warming and without the long-term radioactive waste associated with conventional ﬁssion power stations. More importantly, within the next 20 years large-scale fusion power production is planned to be demonstrated by the multinational experiment ITER, and a proposed ‘fast track’ to fusion envisages a time-scale of roughly 30 years for a prototype power plant PROTO to be built.},

	abstract = {Increasing the pressure by additional heating of magnetically conﬁned plasmas had the consequence that turbulent processes became more violent and plasma conﬁnement degraded. Since this experience from the early 1980ies, fusion research was dominated by the search for conﬁnement regimes with improved properties. It was a gratifying experience that toroidally conﬁned plasmas are able to self-organise in such a way that turbulence diminishes, resulting in a conﬁnement with good prospects to reach the objectives of fusion R\&D. The understanding of improved conﬁnement regimes revolutionized the understanding of turbulent transport in high-temperature plasmas. In this paper the story of research into improved conﬁnement regimes will be narrated starting with 1980.},

This technique allows measurements of the density proﬁle and the plasma turbulence-rotation velocity at the lower extraordinary wave from a plasma with a critical density to the center of the plasma column. The system also allows one to probe the plasma column at the ordinary wave. It is proposed to use a combined mirror–horn antenna system. Under conditions where there is limited space for placing horns, this results in a signiﬁcant (up to 20 dB) increase in the signal, compared to the system of two horns considered earlier. The results of calculations on optimizing the elements of the waveguide transmission line using a two-dimensional full-wave code are presented. The possibility of employing the Doppler effect to study plasma rotation by using antennas for controlling the shape of the plasma column while performing reﬂectometry at the lower extraordinary wave is considered.

This required both advanced technology integration and steady-state real-time plasma control. In particular, an improvement of the plasma position to within a range of few millimetres, and new real-time controls of radio frequency power and various actuators built around a shared memory network, have allowed Tore Supra to access a powerful steady-state regime with an improved safety level for the actively cooled plasma facing components. Feedback controlled fully non-inductive plasma discharges have been sustained in a steady-state regime for up to 6 min with a new world record for injected–extracted energy exceeding 1 GJ.

	abstract = {In many tokamak and stellarator experiments around the globe that are investigating energy production via controlled thermonuclear fusion, electron cyclotron heating and current drive (ECH\&CD) are used for plasma start-up, heating, non-inductive current drive and magnetohydrodynamic stability control. ECH will be the first auxiliary heating method used on ITER. Megawatt-class, continuous wave gyrotrons are employed as high-power millimeter (mm)-wave sources. The present review reports on the worldwide state-of-the-art of highpower gyrotrons. Their successful development during recent years changed ECH from a minor to a major heating method. After a general introduction of the various functions of ECH\&CD in fusion physics, especially for ITER, section 2 will explain the fast-wave gyrotron interaction principle. Section 3 discusses innovations on the components of modern long-pulse fusion gyrotrons (magnetron injection electron gun, beam tunnel, cavity, quasi-optical output coupler, synthetic diamond output window, single-stage depressed collector) and auxiliary components (superconducting magnets, gyrotron diagnostics, high-power calorimetric dummy loads). Section 4 deals with present megawatt-class gyrotrons for ITER, W7-X, LHD, EAST, KSTAR and JT-60SA, and also includes tubes for moderate pulse length machines such as ASDEX-U, DIII-D, HL-2A, TCV, QUEST and GAMMA-10. In section 5 the development of future advanced fusion gyrotrons is discussed. These are tubes with higher frequencies for DEMO, multi-frequency (multi-purpose) gyrotrons, stepwise frequency tunable tubes for plasma stabilization, injection-locked and coaxial-cavity multi-megawatt gyrotrons, as well as sub-THz gyrotrons for collective Thomson scattering. Efficiency enhancement via multi-stage depressed collectors, fast oscillation recovery methods and reliability, availability, maintainability and inspectability will be discussed at the end of this section.},

The IPB provided methodologies for projecting the performance of burning plasmas, developed largely through coordinated experimental, modelling and theoretical activities carried out on today’s large tokamaks (ITER Physics R\&D). In the IPB, projections for ITER (1998 Design) were also presented. The IPB also pointed out some outstanding issues. These issues have been addressed by the Participant Teams of ITER (the European Union, Japan, Russia and the USA), for which International Tokamak Physics Activities (ITPA) provided a forum of scientists, focusing on open issues pointed out in the IPB. The new methodologies of projection and control are applied to ITER, which was redesigned under revised technical objectives. These analyses suggest that the achievement of Q {\textgreater} 10 in the inductive operation is feasible. Further, improved conﬁnement and beta observed with low shear (= high βp = ‘hybrid’) operation scenarios, if achieved in ITER, could provide attractive scenarios with high Q({\textgreater} 10), long pulse ({\textgreater}1000 s) operation with beta {\textless}no-wall limit and benign ELMs.},

	abstract = {The superconducting tokamak Tore Supra was built in the 1980s, when the Joint European Torus (JET) started operation, with the aim of addressing technological and scientific questions relevant to long-pulse operation, in complement to JET objectives. The past 20 years of operation have confirmed that it was essential to integrate within a single device the features of high-performance long pulses in order to progress on the technological side with the level of effort needed for integration and interface management. Besides the 20 years of successful operation of the superconducting magnet, successive developments of the actively cooled plasma-facing components have allowed us to increase progressively the level of performance of Tore Supra. Since 2001, Tore Supra has been operated with an actively cooled toroidal pump limiter, complemented by actively cooled antenna protections and wall protection [Composants Internes et Limiteur (CIEL) project], capable of removing up to 20 to 25 MW of power. The high-performance long-pulse capability of Tore Supra culminated in 2003 with record discharge durations of 6 min driven by lower hybrid current drive (LHCD). Although Tore Supra has a circular cross section, which departs from the favorite divertor edge configuration, it has been possible to address original physics questions that are of importance for current and future scientific choices of ITER and beyond, e.g., plasma discharges driven by LHCD or ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH) (no neutral beams), carbon wall environment at constant temperature, ergodic edge, pellet/supersonic gas injection, electron cyclotron resonance heating–assisted mode control or plasma breakdown, etc. The large heat exhaust margin available with the CIEL components has made possible the current installation of a new LHCD power system with 16 upgraded 700-kW klystrons and an actively cooled passive/active lower hybrid antenna, which opens the prospects for larger-density operation and larger ICRH coupling and therefore higher-performance plasmas (higher bootstrap fraction) over discharges of the same or longer duration. This paper briefly sketches the research reported in this special issue of Fusion Science and Technology dedicated to the Tore Supra tokamak. It briefly sketches its history, describes its mission, and outlines its physics and technology results.},

	abstract = {Tore Supra routinely addresses the physics and technology of very long-duration plasma discharges, thus bringing precious information on critical issues of long pulse operation of ITER. A new ITER relevant lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) launcher has allowed coupling to the plasma a power level of 2.7 MW for 78 s, corresponding to a power density close to the design value foreseen for an ITER LHCD system. In accordance with the expectations, long distance (10 cm) power coupling has been obtained. Successive stationary states of the plasma current proﬁle have been controlled in real-time featuring (i) control of sawteeth with varying plasma parameters, (ii) obtaining and sustaining a ‘hot core’ plasma regime, (iii) recovery from a voluntarily triggered deleterious magnetohydrodynamic regime. The scrape-off layer (SOL) parameters and power deposition have been documented during L-mode rampup phase, a crucial point for ITER before the X-point formation. Disruption mitigation studies have been conducted with massive gas injection, evidencing the difference between He and Ar and the possible role of the q = 2 surface in limiting the gas penetration. ICRF assisted wall conditioning in the presence of magnetic ﬁeld has been investigated, culminating in the demonstration that this conditioning scheme allows one to recover normal operation after disruptions. The effect of the magnetic ﬁeld ripple on the intrinsic plasma rotation has been studied, showing the competition between turbulent transport processes and ripple toroidal friction. During dedicated dimensionless experiments, the effect of varying the collisionality on turbulence wavenumber spectra has been documented, giving new insight into the turbulence mechanism. Turbulence measurements have also allowed quantitatively comparing experimental results with predictions by 5D gyrokinetic codes: numerical results simultaneously match the magnitude of effective heat diffusivity, rms values of density ﬂuctuations and wavenumber spectra. A clear correlation between electron temperature gradient and impurity transport in the very core of the plasma has been observed, strongly suggesting the existence of a threshold above which transport is dominated by turbulent electron modes. Dynamics of edge turbulent ﬂuctuations has been studied by correlating data from fast imaging cameras and Langmuir probes, yielding a coherent picture of transport processes involved in the SOL.},

On Tore Supra, scattering diagnostics and reflectometers have been used to measure density fluctuations in the plasma core. A cross-polarization scattering diagnostic was also the first diagnostic to measure the turbulence magnetic fluctuations in a fusion plasma core. This paper presents the principle and the experimental setup of these diagnostics, with chosen results illustrating their capabilities to determine the spatial structure of the turbulence and to assess the link between energy transport and fluctuations. These flexible and complementary measurements made it possible to analyze the confinement and fluctuation scaling laws with nondimensional parameters, which requires a wide variety of plasma conditions.},

The equivalent two-port can be characterized by a 2 x 2 admittance matrix Y;j,the off-diagonal elements of which are non-zero due to the reactive coupling between the elements in the antenna array. By connecting another two-port network (a "decoupler") in parallel with the two feedlines, it is possible to reduce the off-diagonal elements of the admittance matrix describing the resulting two-port device to zero, thereby effectively producing a system with no coupling between the two feedlines.

	abstract = {An assessment of alpha particle confinement is performed in the European DEMO reference design. 3D MHD equilibria with nested flux-surfaces and single magnetic axis are obtained with the VMEC free-boundary code, thereby including the plasma response to the magnetic ripple created by the finite number of TF coils. Populations of fusion alphas that are consistent with the equilibrium profiles are evolved until slowing-down with the VENUS-LEVIS orbit code in the guiding-centre approximation. Fast ion losses through the last-closed flux-surface are numerically evaluated with two ripple models: (1) using the 3D equilibrium and (2) algebraically adding the non-axisymmetric ripple perturbation to the 2D equilibrium. By virtue of the small ripple field and its non-resonant nature, both models quantitatively agree. Differences are however noted in the toroidal location of particles losses on the last-closed flux-surface, which in the first case is 3D and in the second not. Superbanana transport, i.e. ripple-well trapping and separatrix crossing, is expected to be the dominant loss mechanism, the strongest effect on alphas being between 100–200 KeV. Above this, stochastic ripple diffusion is responsible for a rather weak loss rate, as the stochastisation threshold is observed numerically to be higher than analytic estimates. The level of ripple in the current 18 TF coil design of the European DEMO is not found to be detrimental to fusion alpha confinement.},

Because of its complete set of actively cooled PFCs, Tore Supra offers a unique opportunity to study this phenomenon in conditions where the plasma exposure time is much longer than the thermal equilibration time of the PFCs. In addition to the main characteristics of permanent retention measured during long-discharge operation, this paper discusses the different mechanisms possibly at work in the continuous increase of the in-vessel inventory and describes the morphology and physical properties of the deposits found at several locations in the vacuum chamber. The main results are (1) that D retention mainly depends on the lower hybrid power coupled to the plasma and, to a lesser extent, on the edge temperature and fueling method, (2) that permanent D retention is mainly due to codeposition, and (3) that the hydrogenated carbon deposits present at the surface of the different PFCs are strongly disorganized graphite carbons when they are exposed to high heat fluxes, whose formation occurs through a heterogeneous growth involving both codeposition of nanoparticles and basic structural unit vapor condensates.},

It considers the methods of maintaining a plasma in equilibrium with the help of a conducting casing, an external maintaining field and the iron core of a transformer. Attention is paid to the role of the inhomogeneity of the maintaining field. It is shown in particular how the shape of the column cross-section depends on the curvature of the lines of force of the maintaining field. For the case (which has practical importance) weak asymmetry of the field distribution in the transverse cross-section, this paper describes a uniform method of consideration, which takes into account the influence of different factors on the equilibrium position of the column. This method is used for calculating plasma equilibrium in a Tokamak model with a conducting casing. Account is here taken of the effect of gaps in the casing and of finite electrical conductivity. Some cases of plasma equilibrium which are outside the standard Tokamak scheme are also considered, such as equilibrium in a conducting shell having the shape of a racetrack, equilibrium where the whole current is transferred by relativistic runaway electrons and equilibrium at high plasma pressure 8j {\textasciitilde}R/a.},

A critical issue for Demo is whether MHD and energetic particle modes driven by fast particles will become unstable and affect plasma performance. Self-heating effects are expected to be especially important for control of steady-state plasmas with internal transport barriers (ITBs) and high bootstrap current fractions. Experimental data from ITER will improve strongly the physics basis of projections to Demo of major plasma parameters such as the energy conﬁnement time, beta and density limits, edge pedestal temperature and density, and thermal loads on in-vessel components caused by ELMs and disruptions. ITER will also serve as a test bed for fusion technology studies, such as power plant plasma diagnostics, heating and current drive systems, plasma facing components, divertor and blanket modules. Finally, ITER is expected to provide beneﬁts for the understanding of burning plasma behaviour in other magnetic conﬁnement schemes.},

	abstract = {The article begins with a brief review of the achievements of Russian tokamaks in the active period of their development from 1962 to 1973, under the leadership of academician L.A. Artsimovich. During these years, the following basic issues were solved: the equilibrium problem, the MHD stability of the plasma column, and creation of the hot plasma with intense DD neutron radiation. It was shown that the ion confinement in tokamaks is close to the neoclassical model, and the electron confinement is abnormal. It improves with the increasing frequency of collisions, the opposite of the case with ions, in what is known as the alternative model of confinement along the magnetic field. Finally, the first scaling law for the energy lifetime of plasma was obtained, which accurately predicted the plasma parameters of the next generation of tokamaks (the so-called T-4 scaling). The subsequent movement in this direction (the ‘Artsimovich vector’) led to the creation of DT reactors with a fusion power of up to 10 MW (TFTR, JET) and to the ITER project. The main objective of the further development of tokamaks is their transition to steady-state fusion operation, which is a prerequisite for their use in industrial power generation. This makes it necessary to re-evaluate the achievements and obstacles that have to be overcome. The first limitation which thus arises is the so-called PH/S limit, which limits the value of the plasma heating power in a tokamak, as well as the discharge duration ∆t (the ‘TRIAM vector’) in current tokamaks (∆t {\textasciitilde} 1/(PH/S)1.7). Analysis of the existing experimental data shows that the most probable reason for the limitation of PH in existing tokamaks is the breakdown of the plasma sheath in the places of direct contact of the plasma with the wall. The reason for limiting the discharge duration ∆t may be the gradual accumulation of the erosion products in the contact zones of the plasma with the tokamak first wall, which can facilitate such a breakdown. Creating a closed circulating lithium flow between the first wall and plasma is proposed as the solution to the problem of accumulation of the products of the first wall erosion. Preliminary studies (appendices A and B) have shown that the undesirable accumulation of tritium in the protective lithium films can be avoided if the temperature of the wall of the tokamak discharge chamber does not exceed 400 °C.},

The idea was to confront the students of the 16th Ettore Majorana School on Diagnostics and Technology Developments with as many aspects of the design of optical diagnostics as possible. After an elementary review of the basics of charge-exchange, of typical spectra, of intended measurements and of the expected associated background, the DNB (diagnostic neutral beam) is brieﬂy presented. The light collection and transport to the ex-vessel ﬁbres and spectrometers constitutes the main part of this contribution: building on existing telescope and endoscope systems, the choice of a suitable optical layout for the core-plasma CXRS diagnostic at ITER is discussed. An account follows of the protective measures against the degradation of the ﬁrst mirror, which will be exposed to high particle and heat ﬂuxes: an appropriate duct, a shutter and, possibly, a cleaning discharge with ‘‘End-of-Cleaning Indicator’’.},

	abstract = {A fusion nuclear science facility (FNSF) could play an important role in the development of fusion energy by providing the nuclear environment needed to develop fusion materials and components. The spherical torus/tokamak (ST) is a leading candidate for an FNSF due to its potentially high neutron wall loading and modular configuration. A key consideration for the choice of FNSF configuration is the range of achievable missions as a function of device size. Possible missions include: providing high neutron wall loading and fluence, demonstrating tritium self-sufficiency, and demonstrating electrical self-sufficiency. All of these missions must also be compatible with a viable divertor, first-wall, and blanket solution. ST-FNSF configurations have been developed simultaneously incorporating for the first time: (1) a blanket system capable of tritium breeding ratio TBR  ≈  1, (2) a poloidal field coil set supporting high elongation and triangularity for a range of internal inductance and normalized beta values consistent with NSTX/NSTX-U previous/planned operation, (3) a long-legged divertor analogous to the MAST-U divertor which substantially reduces projected peak divertor heat-flux and has all outboard poloidal field coils outside the vacuum chamber and superconducting to reduce power consumption, and (4) a vertical maintenance scheme in which blanket structures and the centerstack can be removed independently. Progress in these ST-FNSF missions versus configuration studies including dependence on plasma major radius R0 for a range 1 m–2.2 m are described. In particular, it is found the threshold major radius for TBR  =  1 is R0 ⩾ 1.7 m, and a smaller R0  =  1 m ST device has TBR  ≈  0.9 which is below unity but substantially reduces T consumption relative to not breeding. Calculations of neutral beam heating and current drive for non-inductive ramp-up and sustainment are described. An A  =  2, R0  =  3 m device incorporating high-temperature superconductor toroidal field coil magnets capable of high neutron fluence and both tritium and electrical self-sufficiency is also presented following systematic aspect ratio studies.},

	abstract = {The input power requirements for accessing H-mode at low density and maintaining it during the density ramp in ITER is addressed by statistical means applied to the international H-mode threshold power database. Following the recent addition of new data, the improvement of existing data and the improvement of selection criteria, a revised scaling law that describes the threshold power required to obtain an L-mode to H-mode transition is presented. Predictions for ITER give a threshold power of {\textasciitilde}52MW in a deuterium plasma at a line average density ne = 0.5×1020m-3. At the nominal ITER H-mode density, ne = 1.0×1020m-3, the threshold power required is {\textasciitilde}86MW. Detailed analysis of data from individual devices suggests that the density dependence of the threshold power might increase with the plasma size and the magnetic field. On the other hand, the density at which the threshold power is minimal is found to decrease with the plasma size and increase with magnetic field. The influence of these effects on the accessibility of the H-mode regime in ITER plasmas is discussed. Analyses of the confinement database show that, in present day devices, H-modes are generally maintained with powers exceeding the threshold power by a factor larger than 1.5, and that, on the other hand, good confinement can be obtained close to the threshold power although rarely demonstrated.},

	abstract = {Tore Supra is a superconducting limiter tokamak designed for long and high-power discharges. In its initial phase, the plasma density control was handled by a set of seven modular limiters (total area ;1.5 m2) equipped with pumps. An inner wall (;10 m2), covered with actively cooled carbon tiles, was used to handle high-power discharges. An ergodic divertor (ED), composed of six modules, was installed on the low-field side to create a stochastic edge layer for enhancing the edge radiation; all the modules were equipped with neutralizer plates and a pumping system. The performances, in terms of pumping capabilities and density control, are reported for the modular pump limiters and the ED modules, equipped with neutralizer plates for particle collection. Throat and vented geometries, respectively collecting ions and neutrals, were tested for the modular limiters and the ED. After 12 years of operation, a major upgrade (Composants Internes et Limiteur project) resulted in the replacement of all these plasma-facing components by a flat toroidal pump limiter (total area ;7.6 m2) actively cooled and located at the bottom of the machine. Long discharges (6 min) with high energy input (Ͼ1.0 GJ) have been performed repetitively, in steady-state conditions.},

	abstract = {The ARC pilot plant conceptual design study has been extended beyond its initial scope [B. N. Sorbom et al., FED 100 (2015) 378] to explore options for managing ∼525 MW of fusion power generated in a compact, high ﬁeld (B0 = 9.2 T) tokamak that is approximately the size of JET (R0 = 3.3 m). Taking advantage of ARC’s novel design – demountable high temperature superconductor toroidal ﬁeld (TF) magnets, poloidal magnetic ﬁeld coils located inside the TF, and vacuum vessel (VV) immersed in molten salt FLiBe blanket – this follow-on study has identiﬁed innovative and potentially robust power exhaust management solutions. The superconducting poloidal ﬁeld coil set has been reconﬁgured to produce double-null plasma equilibria with a long-leg X-point target divertor geometry. This design choice is motivated by recent modeling which indicates that such conﬁgurations enhance power handling and may attain a passively-stable detachment front that stays in the divertor leg over a wide power exhaust window. A modiﬁed VV accommodates the divertor legs while retaining the original core plasma volume and TF magnet size. The molten salt FLiBe blanket adequately shields all superconductors, functions as an eﬃcient tritium breeder, and, with augmented forced ﬂow loops, serves as an eﬀective singlephase, low-pressure coolant for the divertor, VV, and breeding blanket. Advanced neutron transport calculations (MCNP) indicate a tritium breeding ratio of ∼1.08. The neutron damage rate (DPA/year) of the remote divertor targets is ∼3–30 times lower than that of the ﬁrst wall. The entire VV (including divertor and ﬁrst wall) can tolerate high damage rates since the demountable TF magnets allow the VV to be replaced every 1–2 years as a single unit, employing a vertical maintenance scheme. A tungsten swirl tube FLiBe coolant channel design, similar in geometry to that used by ITER, is considered for the divertor heat removal and shown capable of exhausting divertor heat ﬂux levels of up to 12 MW/m2. Several novel, neutron tolerant diagnostics are explored for sensing power exhaust and for providing feedback control of divertor conditions over long time scales. These include measurement of Cherenkov radiation emitted in FLiBe to infer DT fusion reaction rate, measurement of divertor detachment front locations in the divertor legs with microwave interferometry, and monitoring “hotspots” on the divertor chamber walls via IR imaging through the FLiBe blanket.},

Within ten years of its discovery by Fillipov and Fillipova in Russia and Mather in the USA, this dense pinch was scaled up to 2-MA currents and neutron outputs of ∼1012/pulse. More remarkable is the fact that most of the relevant physics and scaling laws were elucidated within this ﬁrst decade. The subsequent period has seen this type of pinch used as a teaching tool, developed as a portable neutron source for security applications, as a soft X-ray source for lithography, and as an energetic ion source for nanofabrication applications. This review builds upon several prior reviews. From the plasma physics standpoint, DPF physics is examined in light of fast Z-pinches to examine the similarities. More cross-fertilization between the two communities is suggested as a means to improve both types of pinches. From the applications standpoint, the many uses of DPFs are summarized to demonstrate the versatility of these pinches. Their ease of assembly and relatively low voltage operation have allowed DPFs to be disseminated worldwide as fusion testbeds (unlike their fast Z-pinch counterparts). Smaller or less economically developed nations have made valuable contributions to our understanding of the physics, as evidenced by the rich lode of publications that have advanced the ﬁeld.},

These processes have been studied in detail for the energy range from 10 keV/u to 10 MeV/u. The processes considered include both the ground state and the excited state of the beam atoms, thus allowing for the multistep ionization of the beam in collisions with the plasma constituents and impurities. The effective beam stopping cross-section has been calculated for a wide variety of beam and plasma parameters. The atomic database necessary for these calculations has been documented using the best data available at present. The stopping cross-section data are also given in terms of a convenient analytic fit, which can be used either in computer calculations or for simpler analytic estimates of neutral beam penetration.},

Optimization of both the safety factor q and the magnetic shear s can reduce turbulence, and therefore heat transport. Experimentally, external sources of heating and/or noninductive current drive have been used in Tore Supra to modify the current profile. In these experiments, electron heat diffusivity and turbulence level were found to be reduced when increasing s or reversing the q profile (i.e., negative s). As a consequence, confinement was improved. Core electron heat transport has been investigated. A critical threshold temperature gradient, above which turbulence strongly increases, has been experimentally determined. A parametric dependence study of this threshold pointed out the role of the ratio s/q, as expected by turbulence theory and simulations, thus explaining improved confinement regimes. Finally, thanks to the unique Tore Supra experimental conditions, the role of the q profile on turbulent particle transport was investigated. We have demonstrated that the electron density profile peaking is strongly governed by the q profile in low collisionality plasmas with dominant trapped electron modes.},

	abstract = {The Z-pinch, perhaps the oldest subject in plasma physics, has achieved a remarkable renaissance in recent years, following a few decades of neglect due to its basically unstable MHD character. Using wire arrays, a signiﬁcant transition at high wire number led to a great improvement in both compression and uniformity of the Z-pinch. Resulting from this the Z-accelerator at Sandia at 20 MA in 100 ns has produced a powerful, short pulse, soft x-ray source {\textgreater}230 TW for 4.5 ns) at a high efﬁciency of ∼15\%. This has applications to inertial conﬁnement fusion. Several hohlraum designs have been tested. The vacuum hohlraum has demonstrated the control of symmetry of irradiation on a capsule, while the dynamic hohlraum at a higher radiation temperature of 230 eV has compressed a capsule from 2 mm to 0.8 mm diameter with a neutron yield {\textgreater}3 × 1011 thermal DD neutrons, a record for any capsule implosion. World record ion temperatures of {\textgreater}200 keV have recently been measured in a stainless-steel plasma designed for Kα emission at stagnation, due, it was predicted, to ion-viscous heating associated with the dissipation of fast-growing short wavelength nonlinear MHD instabilities. Direct fusion experiments using deuterium gas-puffs have yielded 3.9×1013 neutrons with only 5\% asymmetry, suggesting for the ﬁrst time a mainly thermal source. The physics of wire-array implosions is a dominant theme. It is concerned with the transformation of wires to liquid-vapour expanding cores; then the generation of a surrounding plasma corona which carries most of the current, with inward ﬂowing low magnetic Reynolds number jets correlated with axial instabilities on each wire; later an almost constant velocity, snowplough-like implosion occurs during which gaps appear in the cores, leading to stagnation on the axis, and the production of the main soft-x-ray pulse. These studies have been pursued also with smaller facilities in other laboratories around the world. At Imperial College, conical and radial wire arrays have led to highly collimated tungsten plasma jets with a Mach number of {\textgreater}20, allowing laboratory astrophysics experiments to be undertaken. These highlights will be underpinned in this review with the basic physics of Z-pinches including stability, kinetic effects, and ﬁnally its applications.},

Many new and exciting physics results have been obtained in the quest for long-pulse operations. The key ﬁndings are as follows: (1) access to H-modes in EAST favours the divertor conﬁguration with the ion ∇B drift directed away from the dominant X-point; (2) divertor asymmetry during edgelocalized modes (ELMs) also appears to be dependent on the toroidal ﬁeld direction, with preferential particle ﬂow opposite to the ion ∇B drift; (3) LHCD induces a striated heat ﬂux (SHF), enhancing heat deposition away from the strike point, and the degree of SHF can be modiﬁed by supersonic molecule beam injection; (4) the long-pulse H-modes in EAST exhibit a conﬁnement quality between type-I and type-III ELMy H-modes, with H98(y,2) ∼ 0.9, similar to type-II ELMy H-modes.},

	abstract = {The ITER plasma control system has the same functional scope as the control systems in present tokamaks. These are plasma operation scenario sequencing, plasma basic control (magnetic and kinetic), plasma advanced control (control of RWMs, NTMs, ELMs, error ﬁelds, etc) and plasma fast shutdown. This chapter considers only plasma initiation and plasma basic control. This chapter describes the progress achieved in these areas in the tokamak experiments since the ITER Physics Basis (1999 Nucl. Fusion 39 2577) was written and the results of assessment of ITER to provide the plasma initiation and basic control. This assessment was done for the present ITER design (15 MA machine) at a more detailed level than it was done for the ITER design 1998 (21 MA machine) described in the ITER Physics Basis (1999 Nucl. Fusion 39 2577). The experiments on plasma initiation performed in DIII-D and JT-60U, as well as the theoretical studies performed for ITER, have demonstrated that, within speciﬁed assumptions on the plasma conﬁnement and the impurity inﬂux, ITER can produce plasma initiation in a low toroidal electric ﬁeld (0.3 V m−1), if it is assisted by about 2 MW of ECRF heating. The plasma basic control includes control of the plasma current, position and shape—the plasma magnetic control, as well as control of other plasma global parameters or their proﬁles—the plasma performance control. The magnetic control is based on more reliable and simpler models of the control objects than those available at present for the plasma kinetic control. Moreover the real time diagnostics used for the magnetic control in many cases are more precise than those used for the kinetic control. Because of these reasons, the plasma magnetic control was developed for modern tokamaks and assessed for ITER better than the kinetic control. However, signiﬁcant progress has been achieved in the plasma performance control during the last few years. Although the physics basis of plasma operation and control is similar in ITER and present tokamaks, there is a principal qualitative difference. To minimize its cost, ITER has been designed with small margins in many plasma and engineering parameters. These small margins result in a signiﬁcantly narrower operational space compared with present tokamaks. Furthermore, ITER operation is expensive and component damage resulting from purely operational errors might lead to a high and avoidable repair cost. These factors make it judicious to use validated plasma diagnostics and employ simulators to ‘pre-test’ the combined ITER operation and control systems. Understanding of how to do this type of pre-test validation is now developed in present day experiments. This research push should provide us with fully functional simulators before the ﬁrst ITER operation.},

These processes include: (1) radiation from low Z impurities, convection, charge exchange and other losses at the plasma edge; (2) radiation from low or high Z impurities in the plasma core; (3) deterioration of particle confinement in the plasma core; and (4) inadequate fuelling, often exacerbated by strong pumping by walls, limiters or divertors. Depending upon the circumstances, any of these processes may dominate and determine a density limit. In general, these mechanisms do not show the same dependence on plasma parameters. The multiplicity of processes leading to density limits with a variety of scaling has led to some confusion when comparing density limits for different machines. The authors attempt to sort out the various limits and to extend the scaling law for one of them to include the important effects of plasma shaping, i.e. rfe = KJ, where ne is the line average electron density (1020 m{\textasciitilde}3), K is the plasma elongation and T(MA-m{\textasciitilde}2) is the average plasma current density, defined as the total current divided by the plasma cross-sectional area. In a sense, this is the most important density limit since, together with the q-limit, it yields the maximum operating density for a tokamak plasma. It is shown that this limit may be caused by a dramatic deterioration in core particle confinement occurring as the density limit boundary is approached. This mechanism can help explain the disruptions and Marfes that are associated with the density limit.},

	abstract = {The French Tore Supra tokamak is upgraded in an x-point divertor fusion device in the frame of the WEST (W-for tungsten-Environment in Steady-state Tokamak) project, launched in support to the ITER tungsten divertor strategy. The WEST project aims to test actively cooled tungsten Plasma Facing Components (PFC) under long plasma discharge. As the existing cooling loop B30 cannot ensure the cooling of the W divertor elements under ITER nominal conditions, a new pressurized water loop must be designed to exhaust all the heat coming from the plasma and transmitted to the in-vessel components. It includes additional piping networks of around 50m3 connected to the existing loop in order to cool components such as stainless steel vessel protection panels, upper and lower divertor coper coils, baffle, bumpers and ripple protection. During plasma operation, the water inlet temperature is 70 °C and the pressure at the inlet of the pump is 2.4 MPa while baking is performed at 200 °C and 2MPa to achieve the outgassing of components inside the vacuum vessel. As the pressure drop of the divertor coils is higher than the pressure drop of the other PFCs, the cooling of these coils is ensured by an independent water loop with a new centrifugal pump. This paper presents the design and thermomechanical analysis of this system including piping stress and supports analysis according to CODETI standards.},

	abstract = {This chapter reviews the progress accomplished since the redaction of the ﬁrst ITER Physics Basis (1999 Nucl. Fusion 39 2137–664) in the ﬁeld of energetic ion physics and its possible impact on burning plasma regimes. New schemes to create energetic ions simulating the fusion-produced alphas are introduced, accessing experimental conditions of direct relevance for burning plasmas, in terms of the Alfvénic Mach number and of the normalised pressure gradient of the energetic ions, though orbit characteristics and size cannot always match those of ITER. Based on the experimental and theoretical knowledge of the effects of the toroidal magnetic ﬁeld ripple on direct fast ion losses, ferritic inserts in ITER are expected to provide a signiﬁcant reduction of ripple alpha losses in reversed shear conﬁgurations. The nonlinear fast ion interaction with kink and tearing modes is qualitatively understood, but quantitative predictions are missing, particularly for the stabilisation of sawteeth by fast particles that can trigger neoclassical tearing modes. A large database on the linear stability properties of the modes interacting with energetic ions, such as the Alfvén eigenmode has been constructed. Comparisons between theoretical predictions and experimental measurements of mode structures and drive/damping rates approach a satisfactory degree of consistency, though systematic measurements and theory comparisons of damping and drive of intermediate and high mode numbers, the most relevant for ITER, still need to be performed. The nonlinear behaviour of Alfvén eigenmodes close to marginal stability is well characterized theoretically and experimentally, which gives the opportunity to extract some information on the particle phase space distribution from the measured instability spectral features. Much less data exists for strongly unstable scenarios, characterised by nonlinear dynamical processes leading to energetic ion redistribution and losses, and identiﬁed in nonlinear numerical simulations of Alfvén eigenmodes and energetic particle modes. Comparisons with theoretical and numerical analyses are needed to assess the potential implications of these regimes on burning plasma scenarios, including in the presence of a large number of modes simultaneously driven unstable by the fast ions.},

During the last experimental campaign, components of the radiofrequency system including an ITER relevant launcher (passive active multijunction (PAM)) and continuous wave/3.7 GHz klystrons, have been extensively qualiﬁed, and then used to develop steady state scenarios in which the lower hybrid (LH), ion cyclotron (IC) and electron cyclotron (EC) systems have been combined in fully stationary shots (duration ∼150 s, injected power up to ∼8 MW, injected/extracted energy up to ∼1 GJ). Injection of LH power in the 5.0–6.0 MW range has extended the domain of accessible plasma parameters to higher densities and non-inductive currents. These discharges exhibit steady electron internal transport barriers (ITBs). We report here on various issues relevant to the steady state operation of future devices, ranging from operational aspects and limitations related to the achievement of long pulses in a fully actively cooled fusion device (e.g. overheating due to fast particle losses), to more fundamental plasma physics topics. The latter include a beneﬁcial inﬂuence of IC resonance heating on the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stability in these discharges, which has been studied in detail. Another interesting observation is the appearance of oscillations of the central temperature with typical periods of the order of one to several seconds, caused by a nonlinear interplay between LH deposition, MHD activity and bootstrap current in the presence of an ITB.},

	abstract = {It is generally accepted that the route to fusion power involves large devices of ITER scale or larger. However, we show, contrary to expectations, that for steady state tokamaks operating at ﬁxed fractions of the density and beta limits, the fusion gain, Qfus, depends mainly on the absolute level of the fusion power and the energy conﬁnement, and only weakly on the device size. Our investigations are carried out using a system code and also by analytical means. Further, we show that for the two qualitatively different global scalings that have been developed to ﬁt the data contained in the ITER ELMy H-mode database, i.e. the normally used beta-dependent IPB98y2 scaling and the alternative beta-independent scalings, the power needed for high fusion performance differs substantially, typically by factors of three to four. Taken together, these two ﬁndings imply that lower power, smaller, and hence potentially lower cost, pilot plants and reactors than currently envisaged may be possible. The main parameters of a candidate low power (∼180 MW), high Qfus (∼5), relatively small (∼1.35 m major radius) device are given.},

	abstract = {Tore Supra routinely addresses the physics and technology of very long-duration plasma discharges, thus bringing key information on critical issues of long pulse/steady-state operation of ITER. During the last two years, its scientiﬁc programme has entered a new phase towards higher power long pulse. Considerable progress has been accomplished towards reliable and safe operation at multi-MW power level in an actively cooled plasma facing components (PFCs) environment. Discharges lasting several resistive times, with combined lower hybrid current drive and ion cyclotron resonant heating at high power level, in plasmas close to the Greenwald limit and Ti close to Te have been obtained. Improved conﬁnement has been maintained together with q(0) ∼ 1.5 for durations up to 20 s. An advanced scheme for the physics and operational integration of plasma scenarios has been developed, and discharges at 7 MW total injected power level have been controlled in an MHD stable region for 60 s. The unique capability of the reﬂectometry system of Tore Supra has allowed detailed studies of particle/energy transport, and a weak dependence of conﬁnement with β is corroborated by ﬂuctuation measurements. A new mechanism is proposed to explain the D retention observed in long pulses. Analysis of large parallel ﬂows in the scrape off layer (SOL) lends credence to the hypothesis that the SOL is fed by long range transport events that are created near the outboard midplane. Finally, new technological developments for in situ follow-up of PFCs ageing are reported.},

	abstract = {We review progress made on the advanced tokamak path to fusion energy by the DIII-D National Fusion Facility (Luxon et al. in Nucl Fusion 42:614, 2002). The advanced tokamak represents a highly attractive approach for a future steady state fusion power plant. In this concept, there is a natural alignment between high pressure operation, favorable stability and transport properties, and a highly self-driven (‘bootstrap’) plasma current to sustain operation efﬁciently and without disruptions. Research on DIII-D has identiﬁed several promising plasma conﬁgurations for fully non-inductive operation with potential applications to a range of future devices, from ITER to nuclear science facilities, to compact or large scale fusion power plants. Signiﬁcant progress has been made toward realizing these scenarios, with the demonstration of high b access, off-axis current drive techniques, model based proﬁle control, and stability and ELM control in reactor relevant physics regimes. Radiative techniques have also been pioneered to develop improved compatibility with divertor requirements, and simultaneous access to high performance pedestals. Research has also developed major advances in physics understanding, validating concepts of kinetic damping of ideal MHD instabilities that enable high b operation, identifying how current proﬁle and b inﬂuence plasma turbulence in order to validate and improve turbulent transport models, and understanding the physics of energetic particle redistribution due to Alfve´nic and other instabilities. These advances have been partnered with development of a rigorous integrated modeling framework used to interpret and validate individual physics models of the various aspects of plasma behavior, and to guide development of improved regimes and upgrades. These tools are also being used to develop and validate concepts for future reactors directly. Having established these foundations, DIII-D is now undergoing a substantial upgrade to raise power, current drive, electron heating and 3-D ﬁeld capabilities in order to validate this physics and test conceptual solutions in reactor-relevant physics regimes, with a goal to resolve the key scientiﬁc and technology questions to enable a decision on a future steady state fusion power plant.},

The fuels for nuclear fusion—lithium and deuterium—satisfy this condition because of the abundance of lithium in seawater and of deuterium in all forms of water. The possible use of lithium-ion batteries on a large scale, particularly in the automobile industry, could, however, use up all the known terrestrial reserves and resources of lithium in the next few decades. Little attention has been paid so far to the ﬁnancial, energetic, and above all, environmental aspects of lithium extraction from seawater. The neutron multipliers foreseen for fusion power plants, in particular beryllium, represent a major supply problem and require that other, sustainable solutions be urgently sought.},

The main objective of W7-X is the demonstration of the integrated reactor potential of the optimized stellarator line. An important element of this mission is the achievement of high heating power and high conﬁnement in the steady-state operation. The approach to this mission is the following three steps. First, plasmas were produced in a limiter conﬁguration [operation phase (OP 1.1)], then a test divertor unit is being installed (temporary divertor unit) for the next campaign, OP 1.2, before the full steady-state capability will be achieved implementing active cooling of all in-vessel components and a steady-state high heat-ﬂux divertor. In December 2015, the ﬁrst helium plasma was generated using electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH), in February 2016, the working gas was switched to hydrogen. The ﬁrst OP (OP 1.1) was successfully ﬁnished in March 2016. At the end of OP 1.1, the discharge duration was close to 6 s, the limit for the integrated heating power was increased to 4 MJ and electron temperatures of ∼10 keV were achieved. Due to the low densities in the range of 1019 cm−3 and the pure electron heating by ECRH, the ion temperatures reached only 2 keV. At present, W7-X is undergoing the next completion phase, including the installation of the test divertor unit, the installation of the carbon tiles on the inner plasma vessel wall, an upgrade of existing diagnostics, and the installation of new diagnostics. This paper discusses the ﬁrst operational phase, lessons learned and implemented, and the status before the start of the second OP (OP 1.2).},

Progress has been made on ITER infrastructure since the 2016 FEC, most visibly the construction of many key buildings. The key parts of the tokamak assembly building and the tokamak bioshield have been completed. The tokamak building itself will be ready for equipment in 2020. The cryogenic plant and the magnet power supply buildings are complete, and these systems begin commissioning in 2019. The power conversion and distribution area is complete and the component cooling water system building has started construction. Manufacturing of the basic components of the ITER tokamak is also proceeding well. The base and lower cylinder of the cryostat have been assembled on the ITER site. The first modules of the central solenoid and of the six poloidal field coils have been wound. The first winding packs of the toroidal field magnets are complete, as are the first casings, which have been verified to meet the high tolerances required. The first vacuum vessel sector is near completion and demonstrated to meet strict tolerances. The Heating and Current Drive systems (NB, ECH and ICH) are in the final design phase. The sequence of complementary ITER operation from First Plasma (FP) to the achievement of the Q = 10 and Q = 5 project goals has been adapted to the Staged Approach to construction, a stepwise installation of all systems. The ITER Research Plan has been revised in 2017 to be consistent with the systems available in each phase. Physics studies focus on the Disruption Mitigation System, design of the ITER tungsten divertor, and modelling of ITER plasma scenarios. Modelling concentrates on the initial phases of the Research Plan and on the Q = 10 scenario, especially plasma termination.},

The tube is designed to deliver 620-kW CW RF power with a mismatched load (VSWR = 1.4) and 700-kW CW with a matched load. Several prototypes have been built with successive design improvements. The major improvement was to change one single RF output into two RF outputs. The most recently built prototype meets all design speciﬁcations at 73.1 kV and 20.7 A, with an efﬁciency of 47\% on a matched load and 40\% with a 1.4 : 1 VSWR load, worst case phase. The power losses dissipated in the body have been measured as low as 17 kW, which corresponds to the RF heating and implies low beam interception.

	abstract = {In parallel to the ITER project itself, many initiatives address complementary technological issues relevant to a fusion reactor, as well as many remaining scientiﬁc issues. One of the next decade’s scientiﬁc challenges consists of merging the scientiﬁc knowledge accumulated during the past 40 years into a reliable set of validated simulation tools, accessible and useful for ITER prediction and interpretation activity, as well as for the conceptual design of the future reactors. Obviously such simulators involve a high degree of “integration” in several respects: integration of multi-space, multi-scale (time and space) physics, integration of physics and technology models, inter-discipline integration etc. This very distinctive feature, in the framework of a rather long term and world-wide activity, constrains strongly the choices to be made at all levels of developments. A European task force on integrated tokamak modelling has been activated with the long-term aim of providing the EU with a set of codes necessary for preparing and analysing future ITER discharges, with the highest degree of ﬂexibility and reliability. In parallel with the development of simulation tools and software environment, the long term evolution of hardware needs is also discussed at several levels (EU, EU–Japan broader approach, high performance computing, grid technology, data access, etc.), and progress in this domain is reported. Finally, the ITM task force is also working out the worldwide compatibility through regular collaboration with the similar integrated modelling structures which already exist or are being put in place by the other ITER partners.},

	abstract = {The Tore Supra tokamak is being transformed in an x-point divertor fusion device in the frame of the WEST (W-for tungsten-Environment in Steady-state Tokamak) project, launched in support to the ITER tungsten divertor strategy. The WEST project aims to test ITER-like W monoblock Plasma Facing Units (PFU). This ITER-like divertor will be tested under long plasma discharge up to 1000 s, with high heat ﬂux density up to 20 MW/m2. This paper presents the results of ANSYS thermal-structural simulations of the WEST upper divertor. The upper divertor is made of twelve 30◦ sectors, each one composed of 38 PFU. The PFUs are actively cooled CuCrZr heat sinks and the incidence surface is coated with a thin tungsten layer. The ﬁxing system is made of pins engaged in slotted holes. Besides, the ﬁxing system of the sector assembly is the same as WEST lower divertor, so one upper divertor sector can be used indifferently in upper or Lower position during transitional operation phases in WEST. The total surface of the upper divertor is 8 m2, and it has to be able to extract up to 4 MW in steady-state, with peak heat ﬂux values up to 8 MW/m2. The ﬁxing system was designed to handle structural loads such as forces and torques resulting from halo and eddy current, respectively, especially during disruptions and Vertical Displacement Event (VDE). The torque resulting from eddy current is ﬁrst calculated thanks to an internal CEA ANSYS APDL routine. Then the ANSYS structural and thermal-structural simulations of the PFU are presented, and its design is validated thanks to A-level RCC-MRx criteria. Finally, the most conservative load case is determined in order to validate the design of the pins and the support structure.},

The calculation of antenna coupling has been traditionally performed separately from those of core propagation whereas this method allows them to be combined permitting the modelling of such phenomena as waves reflected from plasma-vacuum boundary or cyclotron resonances back to the antenna.

However, non-inductive current drive by helicon wave has not been validated experimentally. To validate its anticipated performance experimentally, an antenna design is one of the most important issues. A Traveling wave antenna has particularly valuable features for launching the fast wave such as load resiliency, narrow n{\textbar}{\textbar} spectrum, and simple RF circuits without additional-external matching systems. Low power level helicon wave coupling experiments has been conducted successfully using a mock-up TWA in KSTAR. In the next step, in order to investigate a high power performance, a new prototype TWA based on the mock-up TWA has been designed, fabricated and measured for a medium power (100–300 kW) RF system. The prototype TWA having a Faraday shield was made of copper and consists of 10 current straps with 5 inch coaxial feeding lines as input and output ports. The detailed design parameters and electromagnetic characteristics of prototype TWA are discussed.},

	abstract = {A helicon wave current drive is proposed as an efficient off-axis current drive in the high electron β plasmas that are expected in fusion reactors. A high frequency helicon wave coupling was analyzed using the surface impedance at a plasma boundary. A slow wave coupling, which may compete with the helicon wave coupling at a frequency of 500 MHz, is estimated to be lower than the fast wave coupling by an order of magnitude in the KSTAR edge plasma density and in practical Faraday shield misalignment with the magnetic pitch. A traveling wave antenna, which is a two port combline antenna, was analyzed using a simplified lumped element model. The results show that the traveling wave antenna provides load resiliency because of its insensitivity to loading resistance, provided that the loading resistance at a radiating element is limited within a practical range. The combline antenna is attractive because it does not require a matching system and exhibits a high selectivity of parallel refractive index. Based on the analysis, a seven element combline antenna was fabricated and installed at an off-mid-plane offset of 30 cm from the mid-plane in KSTAR. The low power RF characteristics measured during several plasma discharges showed no evidence of slow wave coupling. This is consistent with the expectation made through the surface impedance analysis which predicted low slow wave coupling. The wave coupling to the plasma is easily controlled by a radial outer-gap control and gas puffing. No plasma confinement degradation was observed during the radial outer-gap control of up to 3 cm in H-mode discharges. In a ELMy plasmas, only a small reflection peak was observed during a very short portion of the ELM bursting period. If the number of radiating elements is increased for high power operation, then complete load resiliency can be expected. A very large coupling can be problematic for maintaining a parallel refractive index, although this issue can be mitigated by increasing the number of elements.},

Shiraiwa, et. al., “HISTORIC: extending core ICRF wave simulation to include realistic SOL plasmas”, Nucl.

Such an extension requires a scalable high fidelity 3D edge plasma wave simulation. We used the MFEM [http://mfem.org], open source scalable C++ finite element method library, and developed a Python wrapper for MFEM (PyMFEM), and then a radio frequency (RF) wave physics module in Python. This approach allows for building a physics layer rapidly, while separating the physics implementation being apart from the numerical FEM implementation. An interactive modeling interface was built on πScope [S Shiraiwa, et. al. Fusion Eng. Des. 112, 835] to work with an RF simulation model in a complicated geometry.},

The non-trivial issue of introducing hot plasma effects was addressed by an iterative algorithm. These techniques are veriﬁed both analytically and numerically. In the lower hybrid (LH) grill antenna coupling problem, the FEM solver successfully reproduced the solution that was obtained analytically. Propagation of LH waves on the Alcator C and Alcator C-MOD plasmas was compared with a ray-tracing code, showing good consistency.

The results show that the length of the plasma column increases as the square root of the applied power and that the plasma density decreases linearly from the wave launcher to the end of the plasma column. These results are consistent with a simple global model of the antenna. Since noise is critical to communication systems, the noise generated by the plasma was measured from 10 to 250 MHz. Between 50 and 250 MHz the excess noise temperature was found to be 17.2 1.0 dB above 290 K. This corresponds to an ohmic thermal noise source at 1.4 0.3 eV, compared with an electron temperature of 1.65 eV predicted by the global model. Estimates of the electrical conductivity of the plasma column based on measured electron number densities lead to an antenna efficiency of about 65\% at a transmission frequency of 100 MHz and an increase in total antenna noise of 1 dB due to the plasma. Theoretical modeling and experimental observations of the radiation pattern of the antenna show that the linear variation of conductivity and finite resistance of the column lead to a reduction in the depth of the nulls in the radiation pattern and a consequent increase in the width of the main lobe.},

	abstract = {A previously reported algorithm for solving the problem of coupling electromagnetic energy in the LHRF froma phased array of identical rectangular waveguides to a plane-stratified, magnetized cold plasma is numerically implemented. The resulting computer codes are sufficiently general to allow for an arbitrary number of waveguides with finite dimensions in both poloidal and toroidal directions and are thus capable of computing coupling to both slow and fast waves in the plasma. Some of the details of the implementation and the extension of the algorithm to allow study of the Fourier spectrum of slow and fast waves launched by the array are discussed. Good agreement is found with previously reported, less general work for the slow wave launching case. The effect of phasing multirow arrays in the poloidal direction is studied, and an asymmetric between phasing 'up' and 'down' is found that persists in the case where the plasma adjacent to the array is uniform. A 4 X 3 array designed to launch fast waves of high phase velocity is studied. By using the optimal poloidal phasing, low reflection coefficients ({\textbar}R{\textbar}2 £20\%) are found under some not unrealistic edge plasma conditions, but most of the input power is trapped in the outermost layer of the plasma. Implications of our results for fast wave current drive experiments are discussed.},

Secondly, heating sources on PFCs have been identiﬁed highlighting the role of the power from each ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH) antenna and LHCD launcher and the interactions between them. A new feedback control algorithm was developed to control the additional power. The real time feedback control of PFC temperatures which makes part of an integrated feedback controller, is a reliable tool routinely used as a basic protection system. Furthermore, it has proven its capability to operate in parallel with other control schemes such as the current proﬁle control.},

	abstract = {Achieving and sustaining long pulse and ultimately steady-state operation of a fusion reactor in terms of physics and engineering parameters beyond transient period is essentially one of key requirements in present non Deuterium Tritium (DT) discharge tokamaks. Since the successful long pulse operation for 25 s at the plasma current of 0.5 MA in 2013, the duration of the H-mode pulse length has been extended to over 70 s, which corresponds to a few multiples of the current diffusion time. In addition to long pulse operation, the plasma performance is enhanced further to high poloidal beta discharge. This characterizes a fully noninductive discharge longer than 12 s, and also achieves both ion and electron temperatures of over 5 keV simultaneously for a line-integrated electron density of 5×1019/m3 and the plasma current of 0.8 MA. Recently, KSTAR reported the long pulse operation beyond 1 min at the injected power of about 5 MW and the plasma current of ∼0.5 MA. The normalized beta was about 1.5 and the total injected energy to the plasma reached to about 300 MJ. It is also shown that the bootstrap current fraction is about 40\% so that sufﬁcient conditions are met for 100-s operation in terms of physics requirements of fully noninductive state. The plasma-facing components overheating issues due to prompt ion loss in the low plasma current operation was overcome by enlarging the outer gap between the plasma and outer poloidal limiter. An advanced tokamak scenario via proﬁle control would be achieved with the new 6-MW neutral beam injection-2, and it is expected that 100-s operation can be possible in a fully noninductive manner at KSTAR. However, a reliable and innovative steady-state heating and current drive source is strongly recommended for achieving the ﬁnal goal of the KSTAR.},

This method requires complete RF beam information i.e. its amplitude, measured using infrared thermography technique, and phase, which is calculated by an accurate phase retrieval method using complete scalar diffraction integral. The complex RF field evaluated at several positions along the direction of propagation is then used in our modal decomposition method which is based on minimizing the error between the original field and the optimized field. The minimization method is implemented such that it evaluates the optimized field by calculating the beam parameters and the complex coefficient of each mode simultaneously. During the beam propagation, after phase retrieval method, it is observed that in several cases the output RF beam cannot be analyzed using simple Gaussian beam equation and therefore, we extended our method to a more general case of astigmatic Gaussian beam of higher order modes rotating along the optic axis of propagation.},

Although the overall speciﬁcations are unchanged, notable changes have been approved. Firstly, it has been emphasized that the H\&CD systems are vital for the ITER programme. Consequently, the full 73 MW should be commissioned and available on a routine basis before the D/T phase. Secondly, signiﬁcant changes have been approved at system level, most notably: the possibility to operate the heating beams at full power during the hydrogen phase requiring new shine through protection; the possibility to operate IC with 2 antennas with increased robustness (no moving parts); the possible increase to 2 MW of key components of the EC transmission systems in order to provide an easier upgrading of the EC power as may be required by the project; the addition of a building dedicated to the RF power sources and to a testing facility for acceptance of diagnostics and heating port plugs. Thirdly, the need of a plan for developing, in time for the active phase, a CD system such as LH suitable for very long pulse operation of ITER was recognised.

Such a regime requires several efficient plasma actuators working at the same time to provide central heating (preferably ions), local instability stabilisation and off-axis current drive. Valuable experience is available from presently operating facilities and will be considerably strengthened by several new super conducting devices becoming on line.},

	abstract = {A computational model is developed that allows one to estimate in a real 3-D geometry the electrodynamic characteristics of complicated waveguide antennas (‘grills’) generating plasma waves in the lower hybrid frequency band. The antenna coupling efficiency and the shape of the wavenumber spectrum are found as a solution of a self-consistent problem taking into account a complete set of waveguide eigenmodes and finite waveguide dimensions in both directions and an arbitrary orientation to the plasma magnetic field. Electric and magnetic fields inside the waveguides are equated to the outside fields represented as a Fourier sum over wavenumbers N g ,N , in the plane parallel to the plasma surface. The fields at the plasma edge are determined by the 2 x 2 plasma surface impedance matrix found as a numerical solution of the wave equation in the cold plasma approximation using the finite element (Galerkin) method. The solution is found on a 1-D mesh, i = 1,2,...,N , in the form E(\%\%N,u ,N,) exp[i(N,y + N,t -ut)]so that the fourth order differential equation with appropriate boundary conditions is reduced to a set of 4Nf2 algebraic equations. The developed model is applied to modelling a quite new antenna design for generating the fast H waves, which can be used for plasma heating and current drive in tokamaks of ITER scale. The antenna parameters are optimized to obtain the best coupling efficiency. The structure of waves excited in the plasma at various angles between the antenna and the plasma magnetic field is considered. The nature of the waves with N , {\textless} 1 excited by the grill is discussed.},

Each range corresponds to different heating systems, namely, 20–100 MHz for the ion cyclotron resonant heating, 2–20 GHz for lower-hybrid heating or current drive, and 100–250 GHz for electron cyclotron resonant heating or current drive systems. The specification of every system will be explained in detail, including the typical set of equations and the assumptions needed to describe the properties of these heating or current drive systems, as well as their specific domains of validity. In these descriptions, special attention will be paid to the boundary conditions. A review of specific physical problems associated with the wave heating systems will also be provided. The review will detail the role of simulation in answering questions that arise from experiments on magnetized plasma devices devoted to fusion. A few examples that will be covered are the impact of edge turbulence on wave propagation and its consequences on heating system performance, the effects of fast particles and ponderomotive effects, among others. A study that is more focused on radio-frequency sheath effects will also be discussed. It shows that such simulations require very sophisticated tools to gain a partial understanding of the observations undertaken in dedicated experiments. To conclude this review, an overview will be given about the requirements and progress necessary to obtain relevant predictive simulation tools able to describe the wave heating systems used in fusion devices.},

	abstract = {This year, TORE-SUPRA celebrated 25 years of operation. During this time, a number of technologies have been developed. First of all, it was mandatory to develop reliable superconducting magnets at ∼1.8 K, with superﬂuid helium as an efﬁcient coolant. For the production of steady-state discharge, three types of radio-frequency (RF) additional heating systems have been developed: lower hybrid current drive, ions and electrons cyclotron resonance heating. To cope with long-lasting discharges (up to 380 s×2.8 MW) and large RF additional heating power (12.3 MW×3 s), actively cooled (AC) plasma facing components were deployed in TORE-SUPRA for the ﬁrst time in a tokamak environment. TORE-SUPRA is now being modiﬁed into a D-shaped axisymmetric tokamak with AC main chamber walls and an AC tungsten divertor, the W—for tungsten—Environment in Steady-state tokamak (WEST). This new facility has the objective to offer ITER a test bed for validating the relevant AC metallic technologies in D-shaped H-mode plasmas. In contrast to other metallic devices such as JET and ASDEX upgrade, WEST will rely only on RF additional power systems. A set of plasma scenarios have been identiﬁed, ranging from a high total RF power scenario up to 15 MW–30 s, to a high ﬂuence scenario of 1000 s with up to 10 MW of injected RF power. These scenarios are able to reproduce ITER-relevant conditions of steady-state heat loads of 10–20 MW/m2, to test tungsten AC divertor technologies with relevant power heat ﬂuxes and particle ﬂuence.},

	abstract = {Fusion-oriented devices using powerful source of electron cyclotron (EC) waves are subjected to high levels of RF-stray radiation. This radiation is potentially harmful for any object made of RF-absorbing material exposed to it. Special material or/and suitable techniques to scrambling the radiation could be needed, depending on the effective expected level of such radiation. Therefore arises the need for a reliable method to foresee the distribution and the level of the RF-stray radiation. A multi-modal antenna, with sensitivity approximately constant for any incoming linear polarization, with great radiating surface and low directivity has been developed. Its purpose is collecting 140 GHz stray radiation from FTU tokamak and Wendelstein 7-AS stellarator plasmas during ECRH and current drive experiments. Theoretical predictions for stray radiation levels are obtained by two different methods: a multiple ray tracing code developed for FTU and a multi-cell code, originally written for W7-X. Both codes have been applied to FTU geometry, resulting in a good agreement with the experimental data from the multi-modal antenna. Descriptions of the antenna design and of the results from both codes are presented. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Magnetic fusion plasmas feature two major classes of low frequency electromagnetic oscillations: waves in the ion cyclotron range of frequencies (ICRFs) constitute a well established method employed for plasma heating and current drive, whereas waves in the Alfve´n range of frequencies naturally occur in the form of modes in close interaction with fast particles. The propagation of these waves is characterized by signiﬁcant space-dispersion, making it necessary to incorporate non-local effects in the global kinetic full-wave codes which are often employed for their simulation. We present here a variational approach to this problem, which has the advantage of providing a common framework to the wave calculation and to the quasilinear response description. Two important points are discussed: ﬁrstly, we show that the irreversible part of the power transferred from the wave to the plasma particles is directly available and does not require an explicit evaluation of the kinetic ﬂux; secondly, it is demonstrated that the symmetry of the obtained plasma functional ensures that these energy transfers are described in a consistent fashion, regardless of the level of approximation employed to evaluate the particle Hamiltonian. Finally, quasi-local, ﬁnite Larmor radius expressions are derived in the framework of this formalism and implemented in a new multi-dimensional full-wave code, named EVE, which is employed to analyse two ICRF heating scenarios for ITER.},

In order to provide lowloss transmission, the waveguides need to be several wavelengths in diameter. Corrugating the walls reduces the loss further not only in straight runs but also at bends, and makes the waveguide robust against small deformations. We present results of theoretical calculations showing that these properties can be maintained over very wide bandwidths suitable for ITER applications. The computer code used to make these calculations is based on a space-harmonic analysis of the fields. Measurements on waveguides are described that validate the theory for corrugated waveguides semiquantitatively. Tolerances on the corrugation geometry, waveguide bore, waveguide junctions, input Gaussian beam alignment, and waveguide support alignment are discussed. It is shown that the low-loss properties of corrugated waveguide are insensitive to many variations in geometry and deviations from ideality. Finally, some fabrication considerations are presented. In order to provide more complete coverage of the waveguides themselves, only brief mention is made of the losses due to input coupling and components such as bends.

	abstract = {A technique for the measurement of the absolute electron density in low-pressure plasmas using microwaves is described. It is based on observing the propagation of electromagnetic surface waves (SW) at a plasma-sheath boundary, guided by a dielectric cylinder immersed in the plasma. The transmission spectrum is measured between two antennas situated at either end of the dielectric cylinder and connected to a network analyser. Analytical theory based on the Trivelpiece–Gould work (Trivelpiece and Gould 1959 J. Appl. Phys. 30 1784, Trivelpiece 1967 Slow-Wave Propagation in Plasma Waveguides) indicate√s that the lowest frequency at which the SW can propagate is equal to 1/ 2 of the plasma frequency, which is directly related to the electron number density at the plasma-sheath boundary. We call this probe the plasma transmission probe (PTP) in contrast to the plasma absorption probe proposed by Sugai and co-workers (Kokura et al 1999 Japan. J. Appl. Phys. 38 5262). The PTP is promising for the measurement of low densities ( 109 cm−3) at relatively high gas pressure ( 1 Torr). An axi-symmetric ﬁnite element model of the probe is presented and used to calculate transmission spectra. Experimental spectra measured in a radio-frequency capacitively coupled discharge in argon at various plasma densities and pressures (40–750 mTorr) are presented and compared with the calculated ones. Plasma densities derived from the transmission spectra were compared with those obtained with a Langmuir probe. The PTP was also compared with a microwave 1/4-wave resonator (‘hairpin probe’) at low pressure (5–45 mTorr) in an ICP discharge in argon. The densities determined by the PTP were found to be lower by a factor of 0.5–0.7 compared with those obtained with a Langmuir and a hairpin probe. We believe this can be attributed to the pre-sheath plasma density gradient, as the PTP determines the sheath edge electron density, not the bulk value.},

In parallel, after demonstration in the factory of proper operation of the prototype gyrotron, the manufacture of a first so-called series gyrotron was made. But this gyrotron experienced hard limitations (overheating inducing prohibited outgassing, parasitic oscillations) during the long-pulse tests in Cadarache, and the achieved performance was 300 kW for 110 s. A new study was then carried out in collaboration with Thales Electron Devices, the EURATOM-CE A Association, and the EURATOM-Confédération Suisse Association to understand and overcome the limitations, which led to the construction of a new modified gyrotron. During the tests in factory of this new gyrotron, the output beam showed two peaks, a pattern never predicted by simulations. The gyrotron was nevertheless transferred to Cadarache for long-pulse testing, but an arc on the windows definitely stopped the tests. To understand the cause of the observed two peaks, various low-level tests were then performed on a model of the mode converter with different shapes for the launcher, but without real improvement. Besides measurements, the use of a new software, Surf3D, based on integral equations and providing a complete threedimensional modeling, showed that the problem mainly comes from the third mirror, whose curvature is too high and consequently not well taken into account by the calculation. These technological problems have seriously delayed the development of the gyrotrons; as a consequence, only two tubes (intermediate developments) are presently available on TS to inject 700 kW in 5-s pulses. In spite of this relatively low power, the localized absorption property of electron cyclotron waves has been used on TS in a wide variety of experiments, such as stabilization and control of the sawtooth period, perturbative transport studies by ECRH modulations, and ECRH-assisted plasma start-up.},

In order to predict the efﬁciency of the current drive and where it takes place in the tokamak proﬁle, computational techniques which couple calculations of the wave ﬁeld to Fokker–Planck solutions of the electron distribution function have been developed. In the electron cyclotron and lower hybrid (LH) frequency ranges the wave ﬁeld is often calculated using ray tracing techniques, though more recently some full wave calculations have been done. Ray tracing provides a simpler way of proceeding, but the problem arises of dealing with the situation in which there is not a single well deﬁned beam and diffraction and beam divergence are important. Since an LH antenna produces a complicated spectrum, launching waves in a range of directions, the problem is particularly acute there. In this paper we suggest a way of calculating the wave ﬁeld from tracing of multiple rays using a technique based on the stationary phase approximation. We demonstrate how it can be used and its effectiveness through a number of simple examples.},

The discontinuity of the compressional component of the wave field due to these HF surface currents can be expressed in terms of the FLR contributions to the coefficients of the wave equations, so that the FLR boundary conditions can be formulated in a fully explicit manner. It is also shown that these conditions guarantee the continuity of the power flux through the plasma surface. These boundary conditions have been used to obtain analytic expressions for the surface impedance matrix of a plasma in the FLR approximation, assuming that the WKB solutions to the wave equations can be used near the plasma edge. These analytic results can be used to check numerical solutions of the wave equations against a known case, and to speed up the solution of antenna coupling problems in large plasmas.},

	abstract = {The paper proposes a theoretical model of coupling of ion Bernstein (IB) waves to tokamak plasmas using phased waveguides. To describe the propagation of these waves near higher harmonics of the ion cyclotron frequency, a set of differential wave equations is used, constructed by analogy to the familiar finite Larmor radius wave equations, but in such a way that its three independent WKB solutions correspond to the two cold plasma waves and the Bernstein wave to all orders in the ion Larmor radius. This system has a meaningful energy theorem and unambiguous boundary conditions at the plasma edge. It is integrated numerically to obtain the surface admittance matrix of the plasma. The efficiency of waveguide launching is evaluated by extending the theory developed for lower hybrid (LH) wave grills to take into account the finite height of the waveguides as well as the coupling between TE and TM modes at the waveguide mouths due to the fact that at these frequencies the admittance matrix is not diagonal. If the density at the plasma edge is sufficiently low, in particular well below the LH resonance density, results similar to those predicted by the cold plasma approximation are obtained. In this situation, low reflection coefficients in the waveguides can be achieved with antisymmetric excitation. Excitation of IB waves, however, occurs via mode transformation near the LH resonance layer, typically a few centimetres away from the antenna. Whether this is possible without energy losses cannot be investigated with the present model. As the density increases, the plasma surface becomes very reflective for waves with the ordinary polarization. As a consequence, direct linear coupling to IB waves by raising the edge density above the LH resonance density appears to be impossible according to this model.},

In these experiments the wave spectrum excited by the generator and the antenna is normally coherent so that the standard justiﬁcation of the QL theory, namely that particles interact with a random phase ensemble of waves, cannot be applied. The QL theory is, nevertheless, valid provided that the wave phase seen by nearly resonant particles is effectively randomized before the nonlinearity of the particle motion in the wave starts to become important. In the case of Landau resonances at frequencies in the ion cyclotron range or below, when electrons normally resonate with only one wave at a time, the main randomization mechanism is due to Coulomb collisions. A numerical technique to evaluate the diffusion coefﬁcient of the standard map, due to Rechester et al (1981 Phys. Rev. A 23 2264), has been extended to take into account weak collisions. It allows an efﬁcient and accurate evaluation of the velocity diffusion coefﬁcient as a function of collisionality and wave amplitude, and, in particular, leads to an explicit quantitative criterion for the transition from the nonlinear to the QL regime.},

	abstract = {ITER is a large scale fusion experimental device under construction in Cadarache (France) intended to prove the viability of fusion as an energy source. Ion Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ICRH) system is one of the three heating systems which will supply total heating power of 20 MW (40-55 MHz) up to one hour of operation. Radio-Frequency (RF) contacts are integrated within the antennas for assembly and operation considerations, which will face extremely harsh service conditions, including neutron irradiation, heavy electrical loads (RF current reaches up to 2 kA with a linear current density of 4.8 kA/m) and high thermal loads. Based on the thermal analysis, the contact resistance is expected to be lower than 7 mΩ to keep the maximum temperature on the louvers lower than 250°C. Few weeks of vacuum ( 10-5Pa) baking at 250°C for outgassing is expected before each plasma experimental campaign, under which the RF contact materials' mechanical properties change and diffusion phenomena between different materials are inevitable. CuCrZr and 316L are proper base materials for ITER RF contact louvers and conductors respectively. In order to improve the RF contact's wear and corrosion resistivity as well as to reduce the contact resistance, Au-Ni and Rh functional layers could be electroplated on CuCrZr and 316L accordingly. The application of the Au-Ni/Rh coating pairs is assessed through the thermal ageing and diffusion tests. Wear and electrical contact performances of the Au-Ni/Rh pairs are deeply studied on a dedicated tribometer operated at ITER relevant conditions.},

	abstract = {The coupling of ion cyclotron range of frequencies (ICRF) power to the plasma depends critically on the scrape-off layer (SOL) density since the fast wave is evanescent below the cut-off density. The ICRF power coupling can be improved by increasing the SOL density locally in front of the antenna by means of local gas puffing/fueling. To understand the influence of local gas puffing on the SOL and ICRF coupling and to find the optimized gas valve positions to maximize ICRF coupling in ITER, the 3D SOL code EMC3-EIRENE is used to calculate the SOL density, and the ICRF antenna codes ANTITER and FELICE are then used to calculate the coupling resistances. Purely deuterium plasma is simulated and the total gas puff rate for all studied cases is 4.5e22 el/s. The divertor gas puffing case is considered as the reference case. The density and temperature profiles in the reference case are well fitted to the standard ITER profiles (both for the low and medium density) with proper transport parameter profiles. The gas source is then switched to other local positions of the main chamber while all other simulation parameters are kept the same. The simulation results indicate that midplane gas puffing increases the antenna coupling resistance most significantly (by 150\%-200\%) for both ICRF antennas. This increase is at the same level as long as the gas valve is located toroidally close to the antenna, no matter if the gas valve is right to or left to the antenna. Outer top gas puffing increases the coupling resistance less significantly (by 100\%–150\%) for the antenna with good magnetic field line connections to the gas valve, but the increase is at a much smaller level (by ∼30\%–60\%) for the other antenna with only partial field line connections to the valve. The simulations thus confirm for ITER a behavior similar as seen experimentally in current devices and strongly suggest that ITER should modify the existing main chamber injection configuration to bring one of the four planned injection points closer to the antennas.},

To reproduce the experimental observations, to understand the associated physics and to optimize the gas puff methods, we have carried out three-dimensional (3D) simulations with the EMC3-EIRENE code in JET-ILW including a realistic description of the vessel geometry and the gas injection modules (GIMs) configuration. Various gas puffing methods have been investigated, in which the location of gas fueling is the only variable parameter. The simulation results are in quantitative agreement with the experimental measurements. They confirm that compared to divertor gas fueling, mid-plane gas puffing increases the SOL density most significantly but locally, while top gas puffing increases it uniformly in toroidal direction but to a lower degree. Moreover, the present analysis corroborates the experimental findings that combined gas puff scenarios—based on distributed main chamber gas puffing—can be effective in increasing the RF coupling for multiple antennas simultaneously. The results indicate that the spreading of the gas, the local ionization and the transport of the ionized gas along the magnetic field lines connecting the local gas cloud in front of the GIMs to the antennas are responsible for the enhanced SOL density and thus the larger RF coupling.},

The rapid variation of the rectified potential across the equilibrium magnetic field can cause significant convective transport (E  ×  B drifts) in the scrape-off layer (SOL). In order to understand this phenomenon and reproduce the experiments, 3D realistic simulations are carried out with the 3D edge plasma fluid and kinetic neutral code EMC3-Eirene in ASDEX Upgrade. For this, we have added the prescribed drift terms to the EMC3 equations and verified the 3D code results against the analytical ones in cylindrical geometry. The edge plasma potential derived from the experiments is used to calculate the drift velocities, which are then treated as input fields in the code to obtain the final density distributions.

However, recent attempts to operate such discharges with better conﬁnement performance were hindered by the systematic onset of large MHD activity, preventing any good performance recovery. The associated MHD limit is found to result from reaching the tearing mode limit as the current proﬁle is driven from centrally peaked towards off-axis peaked by the lower hybrid (LH) wave. The speciﬁc feature of the considered discharges is that they achieve a weak magnetic shear over a broader core region than past LHEP discharges, then leading to systematic fast MHD onset (m/n = 2/1 tearing mode) when qmin approaches 2. The present paper reports on experimental observations and modelling which support this ﬁnding and analyses the perspectives of improving the LHEP scenario by combining the current proﬁle control through the LH wave with a signiﬁcant increase in pressure through ion cyclotron wave coupling.},

The antenna phasing was performed on the I-port antenna, which consists of four toroidally spaced radiating straps operating in multiple phasing cases; the coupling performance was better under low wave number ∣k∣ (ranging from 4.5 to 6.5). By fuelling the plasma from gas injectors, placed as uniformly spaced array from top to bottom at each side limiter of the B-port antenna, which works in dipole phasing, the coupling resistance of the B-port antenna increased obviously. Furthermore, the coupling resistance of the I-port antenna was insensitive to a smaller rate of gas pufﬁng but when the gas injection rate was more than a certain value ({\textgreater}1021s−1), a sharp increase in the coupling resistance of the I-port antenna occurred, which was mainly caused by the toroidal asymmetric boundary density arising from gas pufﬁng.

	abstract = {In order to satisfy the requirements of heating plasma on EAST project, 3 MW ion cyclotron range of frequency (ICRF) heating system will be available at the second stage. Based on this requirement, the second ICRF antenna, has been designed for EAST. The antenna which is planned to operate with a frequency ranging from 30 MHz to 110 MHz, comprises four poloidal current straps. The antenna has many cooling channels inside the current straps, faraday shield and bafﬂe to remove the dissipated RF loss power and incoming plasma heat loads. The antenna is supported via a cantilever support box to the external support structure. Its assembly is plugged in the port and ﬁxed on the support box. External slideway and bellows allow the antenna to be able to move in the radial direction. The key components of the second ICRF antenna has been designed together with structural and thermal analysis presented.},

	abstract = {Impurity contamination and localized heat loads associated with ion cyclotron range of frequency (ICRF) antenna operation are among the most challenging issues for ICRF utilization.. Another challenge is maintaining maximum coupled power through plasma variations including edge localized modes (ELMs) and confinement transitions. Here, we report on an experimental assessment of a field aligned (FA) antenna with respect to impurity contamination, impurity sources, RF enhanced heat flux and load tolerance. In addition, we compare the modification of the scrape of layer (SOL) plasma potential of the FA antenna to a conventional, toroidally aligned (TA) antenna, in order to explore the underlying physics governing impurity contamination linked to ICRF heating. The FA antenna is a 4-strap ICRF antenna where the current straps and antenna enclosure sides are perpendicular to and the Faraday screen rods are parallel to the total magnetic field. In principle, alignment with respect to the total magnetic field minimizes integrated E{\textbar}{\textbar} (electric field along a magnetic field line) via symmetry. Consistent with expectations, we observed that the impurity contamination and impurity source at the FA antenna are reduced compared to the TA antenna. In both L and H-mode discharges, the radiated power is 2030\% lower for a FA-antenna heated discharge than a discharge heated with the TA-antennas. Further we observe that the fraction of RF energy deposited upon the antenna is less than 0.4 \% of the total injected RF energy in dipole phasing. The total deposited energy increases significantly when the FA antenna is operated in monopole phasing. The FA antenna also exhibits an unexpected load tolerance for ELMs and confinement transitions compared to the TA antennas. However, inconsistent with expectations, we observe RF induced plasma potentials to be nearly identical for FA and TA antennas when operated in dipole phasing. In monopole phasing, the FA antenna has the highest plasma potentials and poor heating efficiency despite calculations indicating low integrated E{\textbar}{\textbar}. In mode conversion heating scenario, no core waves were detected in the plasma core indicating poor wave penetration. For monopole phasing, simulations suggest the antenna spectrum is peaked at very short wavelength and full wave simulations show the short wavelength has poor wave penetration to the plasma core.},

	abstract = {Since March 2010 the preliminary design of the ITER ICRF Antennas have been developed by CYCLE, a consortium consisting of IPP (Garching), CCFE (Culham), CEA (Cadarache), Politecnico di Torino (Torino) and LPPERM/KMS (Brussels). This paper describes the steps taken to develop the present geometry of the triplet pair Strap Housing Module from a thermal and structural perspective, and shows the critical areas of the structure. Key issues are the manufacturability, (achieved by HIPing - Hot Isostatic Pressing), the ability to handle the radiating plasma thermal flux of 0.35 MW/m², the RF losses and the neutronic radiation. HIPing is necessary to achieve the complicated system of cooling channels inside the structure, which divides the coolant equally in order to supply each strap in the triplet with 1 l/s of water. The components have also to withstand the strong mechanical forces generated by plasma disruptions affecting all internal structures and the elevated design cooling water pressure of 5MPa. In order to maximise reliability, joints between different materials in the cooling water system have been kept to a minimum. Therefore, in the interests of fabricability and availability, the whole structure is manufactured out of stainless steel (316L(N)IG). The low conductivity of 316L(N)IG demands small wall thicknesses to avoid hot spots; however this reduces the mechanical strength. Consequently an in depth FEM analysis is presented, which was used to find and to improve the critical aspects of this important component and was the best means of finding the optimum between thermal and mechanical performance.},

The data can be used for impedance-matching points optimizing, as well as coupling coeﬃcient assessment by deducing the antenna coupling resistance from antenna input impedance. The measurement error of amplitude and phase diﬀerence show distinct impact on the coupling resistance. Generally, the amplitude measurement error has a small impact on coupling resistance, while the phase measurement error signiﬁcantly aﬀects the coupling resistance. Instead of using phase detectors, phases can be extract from the power measurements. Thus, the antenna input impedance and coupling resistance can be deduced from the amplitude of voltage probe, amplitude of current probe, as well as the antenna feeding power. on previous experiments, the impedance measurement technique based on voltage probes array is utilized to evaluate coupling resistances. In EAST 2016 campaign, the load coupling resistance calculated by using such two techniques were detected and the results showed agreement.},

	abstract = {The high-power coaxial vacuum feedthrough for the ICRF antenna of KSTAR tokamak was designed, fabricated and tested. It utilizes two cylindrical vacuum barriers formed of an alumina ceramic. Two cylinders are coaxially disposed between tapered coaxial conductors to form a vacuum sealed connection between a pressurized coaxial transmission line and an ICRF antenna located within a vacuum chamber of KSTAR. A vacuum feedthrough is one of the most critical parts of an ICRF antenna. It must transmit RF power while keeping the antenna in high vacuum, and support antenna elements against electromagnetic forces and thermal stress. Frequently, high-power pulsed ICRF experiments have been limited due to breakdown at the vacuum feedthrough. In order to study a higher standoff capability, the vacuum feedthrough is tested and conditioned in the vacuum chamber with a high power RF test stand. A fast interlock circuit is also utilized to reduce breakdown energy. The amplitude of RF breakdown voltage of the conditioned vacuum feedthrough is measured to be ∼55 kV in the normal vacuum pressure of 1–5 ×10−5 mbar. The breakdown voltage is not changed severely up to 5 × 10−3 mbar. This paper will show the results of high power RF test and conditioning aiming for higher reliability at high RF power.},

New antennas are designed to operate in a load tolerant way which creates low impedance zones that are especially at risk since the existing VSWR protection systems are less sensitive to arcs in these areas. To protect these low impedance areas, a new arc protection system referred as scattering matrix arc detection (SMAD) has been proposed.

Only the slow wave (SW) mode of ICRF waves can propagate and be studied in IShTAR. Therefore it is possible to decouple the role of the different ICRF modes in the RF sheath effects. Numerical simulations of the ICRF SW are done in COMSOL in the framework of the existing cold plasma modelling package RAPLICASOL and the SW is for the ﬁrst time modelled in 3D. To date, RAPLICASOL existed as a 3D wave coupling modelling approach which targets the fast wave (FW). Plasma is implemented as a material with manually assigned physical properties and a perfectly matched layer (PML) is used to absorb the wave energy. Here it is demonstarted how to adjust the RAPLICASOL PML for models with propagating SW. Field structures in the resonance cone shape obtained for the SW differ signiﬁcantly from the FW and exhibit strong dependence on the density proﬁle in the close proximity of the antenna. The lower-hybrid (LH) resonance is a constant issue in the attempts to model the SW. In this work an approach to obtain correct numerical solutions in the LH resonance presence is demonstrated. Results of this work can be used to improve the complex tokamak ICRF simulations, where so far the SW propagation on the edge has been avoided.},

Intensities of the different spectral lines normalized to line-integrated plasma density, exhibit different parametric dependencies over scans of ICRH and LH power and for different toroidal phasing between straps. Materials close and magnetically-connected to an active antenna tend to show better correlation with ICRF parameters – such as power and feeding scheme – than those which are far away or not connected. ICRF phasing did not have influence on impurity, probably due to the absence of feedback control. It is further shown that the plasma content in impurities from divertor region better correlates with the total injected power rather than with ICRF power.},

The model is three-dimensional and includes the effect of connections to a transmission line. It also assumes an extent of absorption in the plasma that is sufficient to suppress eigenmodes. The variational principle gives the self-consistent currents flowing in the antenna, the fields excited inside the plasma and the antenna impedance at the generator terminals. Numerical computations are made for a TFR and a JET antenna. A study of power coupling shows that the optimum operating frequency lies near the plasma-modified resonance. The fields excited inside the plasma are found to disperse far more in the toroidal than in the poloidal direction. Also, at frequencies far from resonance, the large currents in the connections excite fields of considerably larger spatial extent than at resonance.},

	abstract = {The capacitively-coupled combline (CCC) antenna has been developed for current drive by the lower hybrid wave (LHW) on the TST-2 spherical tokamak. The combline antenna was developed to satisfy the requirements of high directionality, low reflectivity, and simple feeding. Since the combline antenna makes use of mutual coupling between neighboring elements, only the first and the last elements are connected to external feedlines. RF powers and power densities of the order of 100 kW and 1 MW m−2 can be achieved easily in small antennas of the order of 0.1 m2. The two CCC antennas installed in TST-2 (outboard-launch and top-launch) excite toroidal refractive index (nφ) spectra peaked around five with the frequency of 200 MHz. Wave excitation calculation using a finite element code shows that the excited power of the nφ = 5 LHW component increases rapidly when the plasma cutoff density layer (where ne = 5 × 1014 m−3) becomes closer than 27 mm from the antenna surface, in agreement with experiment. Experimentally, the density profile in front of the antenna can be controlled by adjusting the side limiter location or antenna-plasma distance, and should be optimized for antenna-plasma coupling, since too high coupling results in a broadened and less directional nφ spectrum, and too low coupling results in a less efficient power coupling. Using these antennas, successful ST plasma start-up and Ip ramp-up to over 25 kA (about 1/4 of the nominal Ip for OH operation) have been achieved with RF power of less than 100 kW in about 40 ms.},

When it is used to experimentally determine the S-matrix of the system under different plasma conditions, pronounced asymmetries in the off-diagonal values of the S-matrix are seen. The S-matrix in the presence of plasma has been calculated with the RANT3D code using measured edge density profiles in front of the antenna; these agree remarkably well with the measurements. The asymmetry is caused primarily by the large pitch angle of the magnetic field in front of the antenna, coupled with the gradients in the plasma edge.},

The present work extends previous studies by using the input impedance (more precisely, the complex voltage reflection coefficient Γ) on each antenna port for comparison, instead of the more commonly used loading resistance or coupled power. The electron density profiles used for the simulation were reconstructed from the deuterium-carbon-nitrogen interferometer and lithium beam emission spectroscopy measurements, edge-localized mode-synchronized and averaged over time intervals from 10 to 200 ms depending on the case; 112 cases were compared from seven ASDEX Upgrade discharges with widely different plasma parameters and two operating frequencies (30 and 36.5 MHz). Very good agreement in ∣Γ∣ was found with the measurements on antenna 3 ({\textless}3\% averaged over a shot), and good agreement was found with antennas 1 and 2 ({\textless}10\%); the code reproduced the correct trend in loading resistance RL in a significant majority of cases, although the discrepancies in the absolute values were rather high (up to  ∼50\%) due to high reflection.

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to incorporating an arbitrarily shaped edge scrapeoff-layer (SOL) plasma and an ion cyclotron range of frequency (ICRF) antenna structure into existing core ICRF wave simulation models. We partition the entire computation domain into two sub-domains: a core and an edge region. Simulations in each domain are performed separately with appropriate numerical solvers. For the core, the TORIC ICRF solver (Brambilla 1999 Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 41 1) was modified to impose an essential (Dirichlet) boundary condition at its interface with the edge domain. In the edge, a finite element method is used to solve a cold collisional plasma model. The domains are then joined together using the continuity boundary condition for the tangential electric and magnetic fields at their interfaces (Hybrid Integration of SOL to TORIC: HIS-TORIC). The model developed here was tested using an ICRH H minority heating scenario on the Alcator C-Mod tokamak (Hutchinson et al 1994 Phys. Plasmas 1 1511). The simulated pattern of core wave propagation agrees well with a standard TORIC simulation. This approach opens the possibility of using a realistic diverted SOL plasma and a complicated 3D RF antenna together with a rigorous hot core plasma model, while requiring only minimal modification to existing RF codes.},

Control of the power and the phase of incident waves into the input ports of the power combiner is important for the power combination. Therefore, a real-time control system was developed, and prompt reduction of power loss was demonstrated.

The FAIT antennas demonstrated higher loading resistance and lower temperature on ceramic feed-through than HAS antennas. Antenna impedance and injected power were measured precisely using a directional coupler installed between the impedance matching device and antenna. It was shown that an injection power of 1.8 MW or a power density of 15 MW/m2 would be possible for short-pulse discharges. The mutual coupling between two FAIT antennas is small enough, since any current phase is possible without adjusting the impedance matching device.

Many of the RF characteristics of the antenna can be simulated with a good accuracy, using a commercial code as HFSS, by replacing the magnetized plasma with a high permittivity dielectric. Salty water solution can advantageously be used as dummy load. All the relevant parameters of the antenna have been carefully evaluated in a large range of straps’ loading by varying the distance between straps and dummy load. For a given maximum voltage sustainable in the line without arcing or breakdown, the power handling capability of the RF system and the improvements in the minimum conductivity (gmin) of the antenna array, produced by inserting in each transmission line a service stub, used for a cooling issue, have been studied. The effects of asymmetries between central and side straps and the impact of the presence of the Faraday Shield (FS) is also investigated. Finally the resilience to the loading variation of a conventional matching unit, made by shifter and stub, is compared to a load tolerant matching based on the Conjugate-T concept.},

The drawback of this heating method is the problem of excitation of the magneto-sonic wave through the plasma boundary layer from the antenna located along the wall, without exceeding its voltage standoff. The amount of coupling depends on the antenna excitation and the surface admittance at the antenna output due to the plasma profile. The paper deals with the optimization of the antenna excitation by the use of sections of traveling-wave antennas (TWAs) distributed all along the reactor wall between the blanket modules. They are mounted and fed in resonant ring system(s). First, the physics of the coupling of a strap array is studied by simple models and the coupling code ANTITER II. Then, after the study of the basic properties of a TWA section, its feeding problem is solved by hybrids driving them in resonant ring circuit(s). The complete modeling is obtained from the matrices of the TWA sections connected to one of the feeding hybrid(s). The solution is iterated with the coupling code to determine the loading for a reference low-coupling ITER plasma profile. The resulting wave pattern up to the plasma bulk is derived. The proposed system is totally load resilient and allows us to obtain a very selective exciting wave spectrum. A discussion of some practical implementation problems is added.},

	abstract = {Travelling Wave Array (TWA) antennas distributed along the periphery of the tokamak are presently considered as Ion Cyclotron Resonance Frequencies (ICRF) heating solution for the DEMO reactor. Compared to the conventional ICRF antenna systems currently in use or designed for future machines like ITER, the TWA consists of antenna sections integrated in the breeding blanket scattered around the machine, each one fed through a variable coupler in a resonant ring configuration. Previous modelling of an antenna system for DEMO with 16 quadruple TWA sections of 8 straps shows that a power capability exceeding 50 MW can be obtained in the frequency band of interest using the reference low coupling plasma profile of ITER. The described system optimizes the coupling to the plasma by providing a large number of radiating elements, which results in enhanced antenna directivity hereby decreasing the antenna power density. This results in a maximum strap voltage amplitude of only 15 kV and maximum inter-strap voltage amplitude of 18 kV. The generators remain matched for all loading conditions: the system is totally load resilient. Following the recommendation of the work package heating and current drive (WPHCD) Review Panel, a TWA ICRH system consisting in fewer sections concentrated in front of the equatorial ports is analysed in this paper and compared to the previous design. Reducing the number of sections increases the power density and its associated voltages. To couple 50 MW on the ITER density profile, voltages up to 30 kV are now required. Some aspects like the coupling between sections and its repercussion on the feeding network are briefly discussed. To assess the feasibility of the TWA fed by a resonant ring as ICRH system for a DEMO reactor, a test on an existing medium size tokamak is under study.},

	abstract = {The coupling of electromagnetic waves in the Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequencies (ICRF) is an important method to heat magnetically conﬁned plasmas. Changing plasma conditions, which originate from processes like L-mode to H-mode transition or gas puﬃng, vary the load impedance of the ICRF antennas. To optimize the power transfer from the radio frequency (RF) generators to the antennas and consequently to the plasma, as well as to protect the RF sources against too high reﬂected power, a system that matches (i.e. transforms) the antenna input impedance to the impedance required by the generator is necessary. At ASDEX Upgrade this matching system consists of two stub tuners for each antenna, which match the antenna impedance for a value preset before the discharge. The length of the stubs cannot be changed fast enough to compensate plasma variations even on the moderate timescale of the conﬁnement time in ASDEX Upgrade. The use of 3dB-couplers allows operation even with varying load, at the cost of a reduced power to the plasma.},

	abstract = {All high power ICRF heating systems include devices for matching the input impedance of the antenna array to the generator output impedance. For most types of antennas used, the input impedance is strongly time-dependent on timescales as rapid as 10–4 s, while the rf generators used are capable of producing full power only into a stationary load impedance. Hence, the dynamic response of the matching method is of great practical importance. In this paper, world-wide developments in this field over the past decade are reviewed. These techniques may be divided into several classes. The edge plasma parameters that determine the antenna array’s input impedance may be controlled to maintain a fixed load impedance. The frequency of the rf source can be feedback controlled to compensate for changes in the edge plasma conditions, or fast variable tuning elements in the transmission line between the generator output and the antenna input connections can provide the necessary time-varying impedance transformation. In ‘‘lossy passive schemes,’’ reflected power due to the timevarying impedance of the antenna array is diverted to a dummy load. Each of these techniques can be applied to a pre-existing antenna system. If a new antenna is to be designed, recent advances allow the antenna array to have the intrinsic property of presenting a constant load to the feeding transmission lines despite the varying load seen by each antenna in the array.},

Although novel matching techniques are being developed to reduce their effects, understanding the physics involved in these variations is of interest to guide and facilitate the design effort. We have studied the dependence of the loading resistance upon plasma parameters for the three ICRF antennas in the Alcator C-Mod tokamak. In contrast with similar studies in JET and Tore Supra, the evanescent decay term was not found to play an important role. The dominant variations could be related to changes in the shape of the electron density proﬁles in the propagating region. In H-mode, the loading resistance decreases as the density at the top of the pedestal is increased, and increases for higher scrape-off-layer (SOL) densities. This dependence on global plasma parameters is generally identical for the three antennas, up to a proportionality constant, while local changes in front of an individual antennas could explain the residual discrepancy. To link the observations with theory, the surface impedance at the Faraday shield was calculated by solving the wave equation in a slab geometry using experimental radial density proﬁles. This approach leads to a good agreement with measurements over a wide range of operating conditions in L-mode, ELM-free and EDA H-mode plasmas, and it can be interpreted qualitatively in terms of impedance transformation in the SOL region. Implications for more complex modelling approaches are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Ion temperatures of over 100 million degrees need to be reached in future fusion reactors for the deuterium–tritium fusion reaction to work. Ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH) is a method that has the capability to directly heat ions to such high temperatures, via a resonant interaction between the plasma ions and radiofrequency waves launched in the plasma. This paper gives an overview of recent developments in this ﬁeld. In particular a novel and recently developed threeion heating scenario will be highlighted. It is a ﬂexible scheme with the potential to accelerate heavy ions to high energies in high density plasmas as expected for future fusion reactors. New antenna designs will be needed for next step large future devices like DEMO, to deliver steadystate high power levels, cope with fast variations in coupling due to fast changes in the edge density and to reduce the possibility for impurity production. Such a new design is the traveling wave antenna (TWA) consisting of an array of straps distributed around the circumference of the machine, which is intrinsically resilient to edge density variations and has an optimized power coupling to the plasma. The structure of the paper is as follows: to provide the general reader with a basis for a good understanding of the later sections, an overview is given of wave propagation, coupling and RF power absorption in the ion cyclotron range of frequencies, including a brief summary of the traditionally used heating scenarios. A special highlight is the newly developed three-ion scenario together with its promising applications. A next section discusses recent developments to study edge-wave interaction and reduce impurity inﬂux from ICRH: the dedicated devices IShTAR and Aline, ﬁeld aligned and three-strap antenna concepts. The principles behind and the use of ICRH as an important option for ﬁrst wall conditioning in devices with a permanent magnetic ﬁeld is discussed next. The ﬁnal section presents ongoing developments for antenna systems in next step devices like ITER and DEMO, with as highlight the TWA concept.},

	abstract = {An extensive experimental survey of plasma potentials induced by ion cyclotron range-of frequency (ICRF) heating was carried out in the scrape-off layer (SOL) plasmas on the Alcator C-Mod tokamak. Enhanced plasma potentials {\textgreater}100 V are observed at locations where local magnetic ﬁelds map to active ICRF antennas. In these cases, the enhanced potential appears only when a local plasma density threshold is surpassed—a threshold that is quantitatively consistent with slow wave (SW) RF rectiﬁcation theory. However, in many cases large potential enhancements are found in locations that do not map along magnetic ﬁeld lines to active antennas without obstruction, i.e. locations that are inaccessible to SWs launched by the active antennas. Enhanced potentials in these ‘unmapped’ locations are correlated with local plasma parameters, ICRF electromagnetic ﬁelds associated with the fast wave (FW) and SW, launched wave spectra, and the boundary surface geometry. It is found that enhanced plasma potentials in unmapped locations correlate with the FW ﬁeld strength. These observations are qualitatively consistent with a model that accounts for the conversion of FWs to SWs at conducting surfaces oriented at an oblique angle with respect to the magnetic ﬁeld, with the SW leading to sheath rectiﬁcation. In addition, enhanced plasma potentials are found far into the shadow of passive limiter structures. These are correlated with the magnitude of the local FW ﬁeld strength, yet the effect does not follow any present model. Overall, ICRF-induced plasma potentials may appear in regions far removed from the active antennas, yet due to the complex response of the SOL potentials at a variety of boundary surfaces, it remains unclear what part of the plasma-facing wall should be targeted to mitigate ICRF-induced impurities. The results also suggest that operating active ICRF antennas in a high single pass absorption regime is crucial in minimizing the effects of the FW ﬁelds on plasma–material interactions.},

	abstract = {The technology implications of potential FWCD systems have been assessed at two frequencies of relevance to DEMO as part of a wider study of heating and current drive systems for the EFDA Power Plant Physics and Technology (PPP\&T), based upon two reference DEMO designs. Using the results of Van Eester et al [1], systems studies carried out for a 62MHz mid-harmonic system mounted on a 23MA 5.74T 8.5m major radius DEMO suggested that antenna voltages close to 50kV, and the handling of the resultant sheath power loadings, are likely to be required if all of the 12.9MA non-bootstrap current drive is to be provided by FWCD. The “wall plug” electrical efficiency of the midharmonic option of 0.18A/W.m2, potentially rising to 0.23A/W.m2 with the future development of solid state generators, however, looks very attractive, and the coupling is less sensitive to plasma edge parameters than for existing antennas, due to the low k// of 2.8m-1. The design could be based upon that presently under consideration for ITER, except for the replacement of insulating vacuum windows located relatively close to the plasma with all-metal designs [2]. A 352MHz high-harmonic option also looks technologically feasible, using a waveguide-based design and a port plug layout has been provided. This option might bring sheath effect and voltage hold-off benefits, but this is far from proven. In this case, systems studies were not feasible due to a lack of firm results from the physics studies. For both options: (a) the RF generators, power supplies and transmission line components required are either already available, or are under development for ITER, and (b) mechanical and material issues associated with the proposed FWCD antenna structures appear challenging, but will need solving on a wider basis across DEMO.},

Relevance of traditional concept of coupling resistance to antennas with mutually coupled straps is revised and the importance of antenna port excitation consistency for application of the concept is highlighted. A method of antenna S-matrix measurement in presence of plasma is discussed allowing deeper insight into the problem of antenna-plasma coupling. The method is based entirely on the RF plant hardware and control facilities available at JET and it involves application of variable phasing between the antenna straps during the RF plant operations at  {\textgreater}100 kW. Unlike traditional techniques relying on low-power ({\textasciitilde}10 mW) network analysers, the applied antenna voltage amplitudes are relevant to practical conditions of ICRH operations; crucially, they are high enough to minimise possible effects of antenna loading non-linearity due to the RF sheath effects and other phenomena which could affect low-power measurements. The method has been successfully applied at JET to conventional 4-port ICRH antennas energised at frequencies of 33 MHz, 42 MHz and 51 MHz during L-mode plasma discharges while different gas injection modules (GIMs) were used to maintain comparable plasma densities during the pulses. The S-matrix assessment and its subsequent processing yielding ‘global’ antenna coupling resistances in conditions of equalised port maximum voltages allowed consistent description of antenna coupling to plasma at different strap phasing, operational frequencies and applied GIMs. Comprehensive experimental characterisation of mutually coupled antenna straps in presence of plasma also provided a unique opportunity for in-depth verification of TOPICA computer simulations.},

	abstract = {A load-tolerant external conjugate-T (ECT) impedance matching system for two A2 ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH) antennas was successfully put into operation at JET. The system allows continuous injection of the radiofrequency (RF) power into plasma in the presence of strong antenna loading perturbations caused by edge-localized modes (ELMs). Reliable ECT performance was demonstrated under a variety of antenna loading conditions including H-mode plasmas with radial outer gaps (ROGs) in the range 4–14 cm. The high resilience to ELMs predicted during the circuit simulations was fully conﬁrmed experimentally. Dedicated arc-detection techniques and real-time matching algorithms were developed as a part of the ECT project. The new advanced wave amplitude comparison system has proven highly efﬁcient in detection of arcs both between and during ELMs. The ECT system has allowed the delivery of up to 4 MW of RF power without trips into plasmas with type-I ELMs. Together with the 3 dB system and the ITER-like antenna, the ECT has brought the total RF power coupled to ELMy plasma to over 8 MW, considerably enhancing JET research capabilities. This paper provides an overview of the key design features of the ECT system and summarizes the main experimental results achieved so far.},

In the reported upgrade, a new multi-cavity approach is introduced, producing signiﬁcant savings in terms of CPU and memory requirements and allowing the analysis of large antennas even with limited computational resources. In fact, by formally separating the structure’s cavities with a number of mathematical surfaces called ‘apertures’, the method of moments interaction matrix is block-wise sparse and, as a consequence, can be manipulated with a far higher numerical efﬁciency; this also allows an out-of-core solution.},

We discuss a method to accurately predict the tuning capacitance values in the presence of plasma operation and for efﬁciently accounting for the capacitors in the performance analysis. The presented method relies on the use of the TOPICA code, a numerical suite developed for prediction and analysis of modern ICRF antenna systems; it is able to handle antennas with a realistic 3D geometry and an accurate 1D plasma model. Very good agreement with the experimental capacitance values is found using TOPICA, providing further experimental validation of the computational algorithm and physics model.},

It is shown that the following plasma density proﬁle characteristics are decisive: (i) distance between the antenna and the wave cutoff density, (ii) position of an optimum density with respect to the cutoff one and (iii) the density gradient leading from this optimum density to the plasma bulk. At each step of the analysis approximate relations are derived and the loading due to the plasma is compared with that of an isotropic dielectric medium in view of the application for modelling or dummy load testing. Examples are taken starting from the case of the projected ITER antenna array with its different phasing cases in front of the plasma edge proﬁle used in the conceptual design phase. It is shown that, for the same antenna–cutoff distance, slight proﬁle modiﬁcations can lead to substantial coupling and therefore power capability variations. Stronger proﬁle modiﬁcations and some critically shaped resonant edge proﬁles are also analysed. The usefulness of a dielectric medium to simulate plasma loading is discussed in an appendix.},

	abstract = {The eight triplets of straps of the ITER ICRF antenna array are fed through 8 matching circuits and 4 hybrids to ensure load resilience. Decouplers are used to mitigate the effects of triplet mutual coupling. They also control the array phasing. The electrical constraints on the decouplers for different layouts with heating (H) or current drive (CD) phasing are compared starting from the TOPICA matrix computed for the last antenna plug design and the reference (most pessimistic) plasma proﬁle “2010low” provided by IO. It is shown that this last proﬁle provides a signiﬁcant decrease of plasma coupling and increase of mutual coupling with respect to the previous reference proﬁle “Sc2short17”. This results in a larger range of decoupler reactance Xdec and voltage VXdec needed. This range can be reduced when using 10 decouplers instead of the 7 needed for the same forward power PGk+ of the 4 power sources. For H phasing only 4 decouplers could be used but with different PGk+ (PGk+ ratio up to 1.5–2.5). For CD phasing and same plasma proﬁle the power capability Ptot is increased by 25\% with a decoupler layout allowing much smaller poloidal phasing than the 90◦ provided by the hyb√rids. A decrease of the distance antenna-plasma proﬁle reduces the normalized decoupler voltage VXdec/ Ptot with no signiﬁcant change of the Xdec range. The recess of the vertical septa between the strap boxes increases the plasma coupling but has the dra√wback of also increasing the mutual coupling between triplets: the needed range of Xdec and of VXdec/ Ptot is increased in proportion.},

The best simulation of the considered ITER proﬁles (for frequency response and quantitative coupling measurements for the different toroidal phasing cases) is obtained by the relation KD(x) = 1 + (ωpi(x))2/(ωωci(x) + ωc2i(x)) (KD(x) = ε1 − ε2 for multispecies plasma) which puts the plasma and dielectric cutoff for all toroidal wavenumbers at the same position. Effects of dielectric losses are discussed. Good simulation of the frequency response is also obtained for most of the phasing cases with a homogeneous dielectric as water but a larger value of KD =∼ 200 would cover all cases. Varying the distance antenna-homogeneous dielectric load can scan a large loading domain covering the one expected for ITER. Illustrations from measurements with the ITER mock-up are given.},

(2) The power capability of the array signiﬁcantly depends on the distance of the antenna to the separatrix, the density proﬁle in the scrape-off layer (SOL) and on the strap current toroidal and poloidal phasings. The dependence on phasing is stronger for wider SOL. (3) To exceed a radiated power capability of 20 MW per antenna array in the upper part of the frequency band, with a separatrix–wall distance of 17 cm and a conservative short decay plasma edge density proﬁle, the system voltage stand-off must be 45 kV and well chosen combinations of toroidal and poloidal phasing are needed. (4) On account of the plasma gyrotropy and of poloidal magnetic ﬁeld, special care must be taken in choosing the optimal toroidal current drive and poloidal phasings.},

At a frequency increased by the same factor the electrical properties of the full-scale system can be measured in the presence of non-dispersive medium. A movable water tank in front of the array simulates variable plasma loading. Measurements of the matching performances of various external circuit conﬁgurations and of the scattering matrix of the system show (i) the non-negligible effect of mutual coupling on load resilient matching by Conjugate T (CT) or hybrid leading to coupling between the matching actuators and the generators and asymmetry in power distribution, (ii) good load resilience of a single CT for the right choice of conﬁguration and number of matching parameters, (iii) the large number of matching solutions for coupled CTs and (iv) the beneﬁt of passive power distribution to the straps. This has been successfully tested in the case of the complete array. The power is passively distributed among the upper half and the bottom half of the 24 radiating straps of the antenna plug. The 4 top and 4 bottom triplets are, respectively, set in parallel outside the antenna plug near a voltage anti-node by means of T junctions. The load resilient matching (VSWR {\textless} 1.3 for an antenna loading variation of about 1–8 m−1) is then obtained by a 4-parameters single CT conﬁguration or a hybrid. The maximum voltage along the line remains equal to the one in the antenna plug and there is a fair power share between the straps. A straightforward robust matching procedure of the complete array is described.},

The ICRF mode conversion power deposition has been kept constant using 3He bleed throughout the ICRF phase with a typical duration of 4–6 s, i.e. 15–40 energy conﬁnement times.

	abstract = {This work presents a comprehensive account of the theory and implementation of a method for the self-consistent numerical analysis of plasma-facing ion-cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH) antenna arrays. The method is based on the integral-equation formulation of the boundary-value problem, solved via a weighted-residual scheme. The antenna geometry (including Faraday shield bars and a recess box) is fairly general and three-dimensional (3D), and the plasma is in the one-dimensional (1D) ‘slab’ approximation; ﬁnite-Larmor radius effects, as well as plasma density and temperature gradients, are considered. Feeding via the voltages in the access coaxial lines is selfconsistently accounted throughout and the impedance or scattering matrix of the antenna array obtained therefrom. The problem is formulated in both the dual space (physical) and spectral (wavenumber) domains, which allows the extraction and simple handling of the terms that slow the convergence in the spectral domain usually employed. This paper includes validation tests of the developed code against measured data, both in vacuo and in the presence of plasma. An example of application to a complex geometry is also given.},

	abstract = {In order to model the sheath rectiﬁcation in a realistic geometry over the size of ion cyclotron resonant heating (ICRH) antennas, the self-consistent sheaths and waves for ICH (SSWICH) code couples self-consistently the RF wave propagation and the DC SOL biasing via nonlinear RF and DC sheath boundary conditions applied at plasma/wall interfaces. A ﬁrst version of SSWICH had 2D (toroidal and radial) geometry, rectangular walls either normal or parallel to the conﬁnement magnetic ﬁeld B0 and only included the evanescent slow wave (SW) excited parasitically by the ICRH antenna. The main wave for plasma heating, the fast wave (FW) plays no role on the sheath excitation in this version. A new version of the code, 2D SSWICH-full wave, was developed based on the COMSOL software, to accommodate full RF ﬁeld polarization and shaped walls tilted with respect to B0. SSWICH-full wave simulations have shown the mode conversion of FW into SW occurring at the sharp corners where the boundary shape varies rapidly. It has also evidenced ‘far-ﬁeld’ sheath oscillations appearing at the shaped walls with a relatively long magnetic connection length to the antenna, that are only accessible to the propagating FW. Joint simulation, conducted by SSWICH-full wave within a multi-2D approach excited using the 3D wave coupling code (RAPLICASOL), has recovered the double-hump poloidal structure measured in the experimental temperature and potential maps when only the SW is modelled. The FW contribution on the potential poloidal structure seems to be affected by the 3D effects, which was ignored in the current stage. Finally, SSWICH-full wave simulation revealed the left–right asymmetry that has been observed extensively in the unbalanced strap feeding experiments, suggesting that the spatial proximity effects in RF sheath excitation, studied for SW only previously, is still important in the vicinity of the wave launcher under full wave polarizations.},

This antenna must perform several tasks in a long term physics programme: fast particles generation, heating at high densities, current drive and ICRH physics studies. Various minority heating scenarios are considered and two frequency bands will be used. In the present work a design for the low frequency range (25–38 MHz) only is developed. The antenna is made of 2 straps with tap feeds and tuning capacitors with DC capacitance in the range 15–200 pF. These capacitors introduce additional constraints on the optimisation and on the maximum amount of power that can be coupled to the plasma: not only the capacitor voltages cannot exceed a certain value (42 kV) but also the currents are limited to approximately 740 A rms to ensure sufﬁcient heat dissipation for the considered duty cycle. Starting from an initial geometry we used the tridimensional electromagnetic software CST MicroWave Studio (MWS) to assess and optimise its coupling properties. By modifying some geometrical parameters of the front face (strap width, antenna box depth, strap length, strap feeders shape), we show that a substantial increase in maximum coupled power can be obtained accounting for the technical constraints on the capacitors. The various steps of the optimisation are validated with TOPICA simulations. For a given density proﬁle the RF power coupling expectancy can be precisely computed.},

The former prototypical FFT system on the E-port 2-strap antenna has been upgraded using new ferrite tuners that have been designed specifically for the operational parameters of the Alcator C-Mod ICRF system ({\textasciitilde} 80 MHz). Another similar FFT system, with two ferrite tuners and one fixed-length stub, has been installed on the transmission line of the D-port 2-strap antenna. These two systems share a Linux-server-based real-time controller. These FFT systems are able to achieve and maintain the reflected power to the transmitters to less than 1\% in real time during the plasma discharges under almost all plasma conditions, and help ensure reliable high power operation of the antennas. The innovative field-aligned (FA) 4-strap antenna on J-port has been found to have an interesting feature of loading insensitivity vs. plasma conditions. This feature allows us to significantly improve the matching for the FA J-port antenna by installing carefully designed stubs on the two transmission lines. The reduction of the RF voltages in the transmission lines has enabled the FA J-port antenna to deliver 3.7 MW RF power to plasmas out of the 4 MW source power in high performance I-mode plasmas.},

In this paper, the current drive (CD) efficiencies calculated with coupled ICRF wave / CD numerical codes for the DEMO-1 design case (R0=9m, B0=6.8T, ap=2.25m) [1] are presented. It will be shown that although realistic CD efficiencies can be obtained in the usual ICRF frequency domain (20-100MHz) by shifting the dominant ion-cyclotron absorption layers to the high-field side, operation at higher frequencies (100-300MHz) has a stronger CD potential, provided the parasitic RF power absorption of the alpha particles can be minimized.},

Operation of the LH launcher with the adjacent ICRF antenna signiﬁcantly degrades LH coupling while operation with the ICRF antenna that is not magnetically connected to the LH launcher minimally affects LH coupling. An X-mode reﬂectometer system at three poloidal locations adjacent to the LH launcher and a visible video camera imaging the LH launcher are used to measure local SOL density proﬁle and emissivity modiﬁcations with the application of LH and LH + ICRF power. These measurements conﬁrm that the density in front of the LH launcher depends strongly on the magnetic ﬁeld line mapping of the active ICRF antenna. Reﬂectometer measurements also observe both ICRF-driven and LH-driven poloidal density proﬁle asymmetries, especially a strong density depletion at certain poloidal locations in front of the LH launcher during operation with a magnetically connected ICRF antenna. The results indicate that understanding both LH-driven ﬂows and ICRF sheath driven ﬂows may be necessary to understand the observed density proﬁle modiﬁcations and LH coupling results during simultaneous LH + ICRF operation.},

	abstract = {The demand for a predictive tool to help in designing ion-cyclotron radio frequency (ICRF) antenna systems for today’s fusion experiments has driven the development of codes such as ICANT, RANT3D, and the early development of TOPICA (TOrino Polytechnic Ion Cyclotron Antenna) code. This paper describes the substantive evolution of TOPICA formulation and implementation that presently allow it to handle the actual geometry of ICRF antennas (with curved, solid straps, a general-shape housing, Faraday screen, etc) as well as an accurate plasma description, accounting for density and temperature proﬁles and ﬁnite Larmor radius effects. The antenna is assumed to be housed in a recess-like enclosure. Both goals have been attained by formally separating the problem into two parts: the vacuum region around the antenna and the plasma region inside the toroidal chamber. Field continuity and boundary conditions allow formulating of a set of two coupled integral equations for the unknown equivalent (current) sources; then the equations are reduced to a linear system by a method of moments solution scheme employing 2D ﬁnite elements deﬁned over a 3D non-planar surface triangular-cell mesh. In the vacuum region calculations are done in the spatial (conﬁguration) domain, whereas in the plasma region a spectral (wavenumber) representation of ﬁelds and currents is adopted, thus permitting a description of the plasma by a surface impedance matrix. Owing to this approach, any plasma model can be used in principle, and at present the FELICE code has been employed. The natural outcomes of TOPICA are the induced currents on the conductors (antenna, housing, etc) and the electric ﬁeld in front of the plasma, whence the antenna circuit parameters (impedance/scattering matrices), the radiated power and the ﬁelds (at locations other than the chamber aperture) are then obtained. An accurate model of the feeding coaxial lines is also included. The theoretical model and its TOPICA implementation have been fully validated against measured data both in vacuo and in plasma-facing conditions for real-life structures.},

	abstract = {The antennas presently developed for ion cyclotron resonance frequency (ICRF) heating of the ITER plasma consist of a tightly packed array of a large number of radiating straps, in order to deliver a high power density without exceeding radio-frequency voltage standoffs. A recently developed three-dimensional electromagnetic commercial software has enabled important progress in the coupling analysis and optimization of such demanding systems. Approximations allowing these codes to convincingly model the effect of antenna loading by a magnetized plasma are discussed. It is shown that, for the purpose of antenna design calculations, a slab of ordinary dielectric with a high relative permittivity, KD, of the order of (c/VA)2, where VA is the plasma Alfve´n velocity, can reproduce the main features of wave reﬂection and refraction by the plasma edge. Multi-layered dielectrics permit more reﬁned approximations. The numerical application of the approximation is illustrated by a simulation of the JET ‘A2’ ICRF arrays, which fairly qualitatively reproduces the experimental frequency dependence of the coupling resistance. The same loading approximation is applied to the design of realistic experimental test-bed conditions for antenna prototypes or mock-ups, using water as a means of creating plasma-relevant antenna loading. Application to a scaled mockup of the ITER antenna is brieﬂy presented.},

	abstract = {Characteristics of a complex-conjugate impedance antenna system for ICRF (ion cyclotron resonance frequency) heating are discussed in this paper. Large RF power is reflected in such transition as that of ELMy H-L mode because of the big change in the plasma resistance for ICRF heating. In such a case the RF power injection to the plasma is ceased to protect the tetrode vacuum tubes. The idea of a complex-conjugate impedance antenna system to mitigate the large reflected RF power has been recently proposed. In this system the RF power is split at a T-junction and supplied to two identical ICRF antennas. The imaginary part of the complex impedance at the Tjunction can be eliminated, which is the main feature of this system. The length of the transmission lines connected to both antennas can be finely tuned to realize a complex-conjugate relation for the two impedances. The reflected RF power fraction can be reduced in the wide range of plasma resistance which occurs in the ELMy H-L mode transition.},

	abstract = {A ﬁnite element code that solves self-consistent radio-frequency (RF) sheathplasma interaction problems is improved by incorporating a generalized sheath boundary condition in the macroscopic solution scheme. This sheath boundary condition makes use of a complex sheath impedance including both the sheath capacitance and resistance, which enables evaluation of not only the RF voltage across the sheath but also the power dissipation in the sheath. The newly developed ﬁnite element procedure is applied to cases where the background magnetic ﬁeld is perpendicular to the sheath surface in one- and two-dimensional domains ﬁlled by uniform low- and high-density plasmas. The numerical results are compared with those obtained by employing the previous capacitive sheath model at a typical frequency for ion cyclotron heating used in fusion experiments. It is shown that for sheaths on the order of 100 V in a high-density plasma, localized RF power deposition can reach a level which causes material damage. It is also shown that the sheathplasma wave resonances predicted by the capacitive sheath model do not occur when parameters are such that the generalized sheath impedance model substantially modiﬁes the capacitive character of the sheath. Possible explanations for the diﬀerence in the maximum RF sheath voltage depending on the plasma density are also discussed.},

We have measured a slab of the ferrite used in the ICRF tuner provided by AFT and from these measurements we have constructed a tabular model of the ferrite and inserted it into the COMSOL code. The results give performance that closely agrees with the performance speciﬁcations issued by AFT. We then used this modiﬁed code to correlate the simulation with the destructive evidence found in the tuner.

We have designed two 3 dB hybrid splitters with 9 and 12 in. coaxial transmission lines applicable to ITER ICRF for load-resilient operations using ANSYS HFSS. Amplitude-balanced broadband responses were obtained with the combination of impedance reductions of longitudinal and transverse branches in unequal proportion, length change of 50 lines and diameter change of high impedance lines connected transversely to the T-section of the hybrid splitter, respectively. We have fabricated and RF tested the 9 in. coaxial hybrid coupler. We obtained an excellent coupling ﬂatness of −3.2 ± 0.2 dB, phase difference of 4 degrees and return loss of 16 dB in 40–55 MHz. The measured data of 9 in. hybrid splitter is highly consistent with HFSS simulations. We found that the proposed 3 dB hybrid splitter can be tunable with amplitude-balanced, broadband response by changing dielectric insulators to keep the inner and outer conductors of coaxial line apart. The proposed 3 dB hybrid splitter can be utilized for load-resilient operations in a wide range of antenna load variations due to mode transitions or edge localized modes (ELMs) in fusion plasmas.},

Fast wave CD scenarios are evaluated for both the standard midplane launch and an alternative case of exciting the waves from the top of the machine. Optimal ICRF frequencies and parallel wave numbers are identified to maximize the CD efficiency. Limitations of the high frequency ICRF CD operation are discussed. A simplified analytical method to estimate the fast wave CD efficiency is presented, complemented with the discussion of its dependencies on plasma parameters. The calculated CD efficiency for the ICRF system is shown to be similar to those for the negative neutral beam injection and electron cyclotron resonance heating.},

A mode conversion (cutoff-resonance) layer is well known to appear in two-ion species plasmas. If the location of the L-cutoff in Y –X plasmas, which can be controlled by varying the Y : X density ratio, almost coincides with the fundamental cyclotron resonance of the third ion species Z (resonant absorber), the latter—albeit present only in trace quantities—is shown to absorb almost all the incoming RF power. A quantitative criterion for the resonant Y : X plasma composition is derived and a few numerical examples are given. Since the absorbed power per resonant particle is much larger than for any other ICRF scheme, the here discussed scenarios are particularly promising for fast particle generation. Their possible application as a source of high-energy ions for the stellarator W7-X and to mimic alpha particles during the non-activated phase of ITER tokamak is brieﬂy discussed.},

	abstract = {RF sheaths rectiﬁcation can be the reason for operational limits for Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequencies (ICRF) heating systems via impurity production or excessive heat loads. To simulate this process in realistic geometry, the Self-consistent Sheaths and Waves for Ion Cyclotron Heating (SSWICH) code is a minimal set of coupled equations that computes self-consistently wave propagation and DC plasma biasing. The present version of its wave propagation module only deals with the Slow Wave assumed to be the source of RF sheath oscillations. However the ICRF power coupling to the plasma is due to the fast wave (FW). This paper proposes to replace this one wave equation module by a full wave module in either 2D or 3D as a ﬁrst step towards integrated modelling of RF sheaths and wave coupling. Since the FW is propagative in the main plasma, Perfectly Matched Layers (PMLs) adapted for plasmas were implemented at the inner side of the simulation domain to absorb outgoing waves and tested numerically with tilted B0 in Cartesian geometry, by either rotating the cold magnetized plasma dielectric tensors in 2D or rotating the coordinate vector basis in 3D. The PML was further formulated in cylindrical coordinates to account for for the toroidal curvature of the plasma. Toroidal curvature itself does not seem to change much the coupling. A detailed 3D geometrical description of Tore Supra and ASDEX Upgrade (AUG) antennas was included in the coupling code. The full antenna structure was introduced, since its toroidal symmetry with respect to the septum plane is broken (FS bars, toroidal phasing, non-symmetrical structure). Reliable convergence has been obtained with the density proﬁle up to the leading edge of antenna limiters. Parallel electric ﬁeld maps have been obtained as an input for the present version of SSWICH.},

The PML technique, while widely used in numerical simulations of wave propagation, has scarcely been used for magnetized plasmas, due to speciﬁcities of this gyrotropic material. A versatile PML formulation, valid for full dielectric tensors, is summarized and interpreted as wave propagation in an artiﬁcial medium. The behavior of this technique has been checked for plane waves on homogeneous plasmas. Wave reﬂection has been quantiﬁed and compared to analytical predictions. An incompatibility issue for adapting the PML for forward (FW) and backward (slow wave (SW)) propagating waves simultaneously has been evidenced. In a tokamak plasma, this critical issue is overcome by taking advantage of the inhomogeneous density proﬁle to reﬂect the SW before it reaches the PML. The simulated coupling properties of a Tore Supra ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH) antenna have been compared to experimental values in a situation of good single-pass absorption. The necessary antenna elements to include in the geometry to recover the coupling properties obtained experimentally are also discussed.},

Radio-Frequency (RF) contacts are integrated within the ITER ICRH launcher in order to ensure the RF current continuity and ease the mechanical assembly by allowing the free thermal expansion of the Removable Vacuum Transmission Line coaxial conductors during RF operations or during 250 °C baking phases. A material study has been carried out to determine which materials and associated coatings are relevant for RF contacts application in ITER. In parallel, RF tests have been performed with a new prototype of Multi-Contact® LA-CUT/0,25/0 contacts made of silver-coated CuCrZr louvers. During these tests on a RF vacuum resonator, currents between 1.2 kA and 1.3 kA peak have been reached a few tens of times in steady-state conditions without any visible damage on the louvers. A ﬁnal 62 MHz pulse ending in a 300 s ﬂat top at 1.9 kA resulted in severe damage to the contact. In addition, a test bed which performs sliding test cycles has been built in order to reproduce the wear of the contact prototype after 30 000 sliding cycles on a 3 mm stroke at 175 °C under vacuum. The silver coating of the louvers is removed after approximately a hundred cycles whilst, to the contrary, damage to the CuCrZr louvers is relatively low.},

They have to withstand a peak RF current up to 2.5 kA at 55 MHz in steady-state conditions, in the vacuum environment of the machine. The contacts have to sustain a temperature up to 250 ◦C during several days in baking operations and have to be reliable during the whole life of the launcher without degradation. The RF contacts are critical components for the launcher performance and intensive R\&D is therefore required, since no RF contacts have so far been qualiﬁed at these speciﬁcations. In order to test and validate the anticipated RF contacts in operational conditions, CEA has prepared a test platform consisting of a steady-state vacuum pumped RF resonator. In collaboration with ITER Organization and the CYCLE consortium (CYclotron CLuster for Europe), an R\&D program has been conducted to develop RF contacts that meet the ITER ICRH launcher speciﬁcations. A design proposed by CYCLE consortium, using brazed lamellas supported by a spring to improve thermal exchange efﬁciency while guaranteeing high contact force, was tested successfully in the Tresonator up to 1.7 kA during 1200 s, but failed for larger current values due to a degradation of the contacts. Details concerning the manufacturing of the brazed contacts on its titanium holder, the RF tests results performed on the resonator and the non-destructive tests analysis of the contacts are given in this paper.},

	abstract = {The dielectric window of a 35–60 MHz ion cyclotron resonance frequency (ICRF) transmission line is designed for reactor conditions in due consideration of irradiation, dielectric heating, fabrication issues, and remote handling. Electric ﬁeld, temperature distribution, and thermal stresses are evaluated for beryllia and alumina dielectrics using ﬁnite element codes. The analysis is made for two annular ceramic septa joining coaxial water-cooled conductors having maximum operating 50 kV peak rf voltage and 30 V characteristic impedance. For unfavourable irradiation conditions ( {\textbackslash} 1023 n/m2 neutron ﬂuence), alumina is found to be heated excessively to about 1000 °C with unacceptable stresses. For moderately irradiated beryllia ( B 1022 n/m2) or for unirradiated alumina of speciﬁc grades (tan l comparable or less than 5 × 10−4), the temperature and the thermal stresses are found to stay acceptable provided niobium or titanium is used as a conductor. Beryllia (BeO) is chosen as a candidate for the window ceramic because of its better thermal conductivity and smaller thermal expansion mismatch with the conductor material helping also the manufacturing process. The characteristics for the ceramic/metal joints are estimated for candidate conductor and ceramic (alumina) materials. Vacuum brazing using active ﬁller materials provides sufﬁciently good conditions for heat conduction across the joint, and the joints appear to be tight enough. Suitable window location on the transmission line is investigated by calculating neutron ﬂuences at the window using an experimental reactor like conﬁguration with 2500 h total burn time (1500 MW). © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Initial simulations performed using both slab and cylindrical geometry suggested nearly complete cancellation of E in front of the antenna structure for certain toroidal phasings. Using toroidal models, the cancellation of E is more modest, suggesting 3-D geometrical effects are important. Using ﬁnite element method simulations with a 3-D toroidal cold plasma model, multiple antenna phases were analyzed: [0, , 0, ], [0, 0, , ], [0, , , 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, /6, 0, /6], and [0, /2, , 3 /2].

	abstract = {In many configurations, an antenna has to be protected from the outer environment by a radome. In this thesis, we propose to use gaussian beam based techniques to take into account the radome effect on the antenna radiation. These beams are approximate analytical solutions of the propagation equation. They depend on the paraxial approximation (low diverging field assumption). We first develop a new approach to expand an electromagnetic field on a set of elementary beams, overcoming some limitations of the two existing expansions (Multimodal and Gabor). Then, we study the interaction between an incident field and a multilayer dielectric object. So, we develop a shooting and bouncing gaussian beam algorithm which assumes that one incident gaussian beam crossing a dielectric interface gives one reflected and one transmitted gaussian beams. Another original technique is proposed using gaussian beam transmission and reflection coefficients. They provide analytical expressions for the transmitted and reflected fields on a dielectric interface (or on a thin dielectric multilayer) illuminated by a gaussian beam. These two techniques are compared with a conventional plane wave approach on several test cases. The results show their rapidity and accuracy. In order to deal with the problem of aircraft or missiles front-end sharp radomes, we finally explore novel expansions requiring a new kind of beams, called “conformal gaussian beams”. Some comparisons with simulations performed with an existing industrial software show their efficiency.},

	abstract = {This thesis reports results of MCNP-5 calculations, with the nuclear data library FENDL-2.1, to assess the effect on the Tritium Breeding Ratio (TBR) for a distributed Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequencies (ICRF) antenna integrated in the blanket of a DEMO fusion power reactor. A representative configuration of both the antenna and the DEMO reactor was used together with a parametric analysis for the parameters that most strongly affect the TBR. These are the type of breeding blanket (Helium Cooled Pebble Bed, Helium Cooled Lithium Lead and Water Cooled Lithium Lead), the covering ratio of the straps of the antenna (the ratio between the surface of all the straps and the projected surface of the antenna slot: 0.49, 0.72 and 0.94), the depth of the antenna (20 cm and 40 cm), the thickness of the straps (2 cm, 4 cm and a double layer of 0.2 cm plus 2.5 cm with the composition of the First Wall), and finally the poloidal position of the antenna (0º, which is the equatorial port, 40º and 90º, which is the upper port). For an antenna with a full toroidal circumference of 360º, located poloidaly at 40º with a poloidal extension of 1 m and a total First Wall surface of 67 m2, the reduction of the TBR is -0.35\% for a HCPB blanket concept, -0.53\% for a HCLL blanket concept and -0.51\% for a WCLL blanket concept. In all cases, covered by the parametric analysis, the loss of TBR remains above than -0.61\%. Such a distributed ICRF antenna has thus only a marginal effect on the TBR for a DEMO reactor.},

Those measurements include the losses of the transmission line and the antenna. An approach to separate the radiated power from the losses is to measure the current in the antenna loops. To measure the current in the short of the antenna loop two current probes have been installed near the short of the antenna loops in one of the ICRF antennas during the 2009/2010 shutdown of ASDEX Upgrade. These signals allow a new approach in calculating the antenna resistance and the launched power and can be used to separate the launched power from the losses in the matching system and transmission lines up to the antenna. Although the calibration of the signal amplitude from the current probes needs further investigation, the amplitude is proportional to the current in the antenna loop. With those probes and a new real-time DSP-based system, the radiated (as opposed to the total power i.e. including loss power) power can be feedback controlled.},

	abstract = {Waves in the ion cyclotron range of frequency (ICRF) are expected to play a central role in the heating of ITER plasmas during deuterium (D)–tritium (T) operation. These waves can also be used to drive current by direct electron damping of the fast wave, provided an appropriate antenna phasing is used. The corresponding current proﬁle is peaked near the magnetic axis, and can have a beneﬁcial effect on the discharge stability and performance. In this paper, two scenarios applicable during the activated phase of ITER operation are compared: second harmonic tritium heating and minority helium-3 heating, which differ in the addition of a small fraction of 3He ions (2\%) in the DT mixture for the latter. The resulting change of the dominant ICRF heating scheme causes the discharge properties to differ appreciably. In this paper, a full-wave code is coupled to a Fokker–Planck solver and a current drive module to investigate in detail the effect of ICRF waves on the discharge. The impact of phasing on the scenario in terms of plasma heating and current drive efﬁciency is studied by simulating ICRF heating with various antenna toroidal spectra. It is found that despite a lower current drive efﬁciency, the addition of 3He in the discharge increases the single-pass absorption rate, the ion heating fraction, and makes the scenario essentially immune to details in the toroidal phasing and fast ion properties.},

	abstract = {Arc detection systems are developed for ICRH on ITER to prevent arcs from damaging the ICRF components. One of the detectors, the Sub-Harmonic Arc Detector (SHAD) is based on the detection of the frequencies emitted in the MHz range by arcs [1], and is consequently resilient to fast load changes. A prototype has been in operation on ASDEX-Upgrade for ten years and has demonstrated its capability to detect arcs. However, to reach the safety level required by ITER, the design has to be modiﬁed to eliminate the spurious detections triggered by plasma emission in the MHz range and to enhance the sensitivity to low-voltage arcs. These improvements, which must preserve the simplicity of the system to guarantee its reliability, are based on the experience of RF arcs in resonant structures acquired on ASDEX-Upgrade and on dedicated test-benches. We present the main features of arcs in time and frequency domains and their impact on the behaviour of the SHAD system. Several technological solutions are based on these data and have to support the harsh environment of a burning plasma experiment. The shielding, the location of the detector, the reliability can be affected by the nuclear radiations. These elements are integrated in the design to make of the SHAD a primary safety system for ICRF heating.},

In the low density, low temperature region behind the last closed flux surface in a tokamak – where the density decays exponentially and where the lower hybrid resonance is crossed but where the thermal velocity is small enough to justify dropping kinetic (hot plasma) effects – the study of the wave behaviour requires the roots of the full cold plasma dispersion equation. The IShTAR (Ion cyclotron Sheath Test ARrangement) device will be adopted in the coming years to shed light on the dynamics of wave–plasma interactions close to radio frequency (RF) launchers and in particular on the impact of the waves on the density and their role in the formation of RF sheaths close to metallic objects. As IShTAR is incapable of mimicking the actual conditions reigning close to launchers in tokamaks; a parameter range needs to be identified for the test stand to permit highlighting of the relevant wave physics. Studying the coupled dispersion equation roots allowed us to find a suitable operation domain for performing experiments.},

We recall the PML formulation as an artiﬁcial inhomogeneous lossy medium, following the stretching into the complex plane of a general system of three orthogonal curvilinear coordinates. We apply the general method in cylindrical and toroidal geometries. We then assess this technique in a simple case combining gyrotropy and coordinate curvature. Our test problem analytically quantiﬁes the reﬂection of Transverse Electric (TE) cylindrical eigenmodes in a gyrotropic medium by a radial PML in cylindrical geometry. The obtained reﬂection coeﬃcient involves wave, PML and geometric parameters at the PML location. The new coeﬃcient generalizes the one obtained earlier with Cartesian coordinates, and becomes equivalent when the effects of the local cylindrical curvature at the PML (stretched) location can be neglected. These curvature effects are outlined and the limitations they impose on the properties of the PML are quantiﬁed as a function of the relevant parameters. Peculiarities related to the gyrotropy are also highlighted. Finite element calculations of the test problem in two-dimensional cylindrical geometry are exploited to verify these properties numerically. Indications are ﬁnally given on how to choose the PML parameters in order to obtain a minimal wave reﬂection at given numerical cost, taking into account errors associated with the numerical scheme.},

	abstract = {We investigate theoretically how sheath radio-frequency (RF) oscillations relate to the spatial structure of the near RF parallel electric field E∥ emitted by ion cyclotron (IC) wave launchers. We use a simple model of slow wave (SW) evanescence coupled with direct current (DC) plasma biasing via sheath boundary conditions in a 3D parallelepiped filled with homogeneous cold magnetized plasma. Within a ‘wide-sheath’ asymptotic regime, valid for large-amplitude near RF fields, the RF part of this simple RF  +  DC model becomes linear: the sheath oscillating voltage VRF at open field line boundaries can be re-expressed as a linear combination of individual contributions by every emitting point in the input field map. SW evanescence makes individual contributions all the larger as the wave emission point is located closer to the sheath walls. The decay of {\textbar}VRF{\textbar} with the emission point/sheath poloidal distance involves the transverse SW evanescence length and the radial protrusion depth of lateral boundaries. The decay of {\textbar}VRF{\textbar} with the emitter/sheath parallel distance is quantified as a function of the parallel SW evanescence length and the parallel connection length of open magnetic field lines. For realistic geometries and target SOL plasmas, poloidal decay occurs over a few centimeters. Typical parallel decay lengths for {\textbar}VRF{\textbar} are found to be smaller than IC antenna parallel extension. Oscillating sheath voltages at IC antenna side limiters are therefore mainly sensitive to E∥ emission by active or passive conducting elements near these limiters, as suggested by recent experimental observations. Parallel proximity effects could also explain why sheath oscillations persist with antisymmetric strap toroidal phasing, despite the parallel antisymmetry of the radiated field map. They could finally justify current attempts at reducing the RF fields induced near antenna boxes to attenuate sheath oscillations in their vicinity.},

The depletion depends on the ICRF power and on the phasing between adjacent radiating straps. Convection due to ponderomotive effects and/or E Â B0 drifts is suspected: during ICRF-heated H-mode discharges in 2013, DC potentials up to 70 V were measured locally in the outer SOL by a ﬂoating reciprocating probe, located toroidally several metres from the active antennas.

This is done via a Green’s function, determined from the ICRF wave coupling equations, and well-suited to open ﬁeld lines extending toroidally far away on both sides of the antenna. Using such formalism, combined with a full-wave calculation using the 3D antenna code ICANT (Pe´coul S. et al 2000 Comput. Phys. Commun. 146 166–87), two classes of convective cells are analysed. The ﬁrst one appears in front of phased arrays of straps, and depending on the strap phasing, its topology is interpreted using the poloidal proﬁles of either the RF current or the RF voltage of the strip line theory. The other class of convective cells is speciﬁc to antenna box corners and is evidenced for the ﬁrst time. Based on such analysis, general design rules are worked out in order to reduce the RF-sheath potentials, which generalize those proposed in the earlier literature, and concrete antenna design options are tested numerically. The merits of aligning all strap centres on the same (tilted) ﬂux tube, and of reducing the antenna box toroidal conductivity in its lower and upper parts, are discussed.},

	abstract = {In addition to the propagation and absorption of the waves into the plasma, a crucial point in ion cyclotron radiofrequency heating (ICRH) is to know how the energy is coupled to the plasma. The coupling efﬁciency is experimentally estimated through measurements of the antenna coupling resistance and it is of primary importance to precisely establish its dependence on the plasma parameters. The coupling resistance is highly connected to the density proﬁle, which determines the cut-off positions of the magnetosonic waves for a given radiated wave number spectrum. For a large size tokamak like Tore Supra these cut-off densities range between 1018 and 1019 m−3, corresponding to the plasma edge. In this study, the RF coupling is investigated with respect to the plasma edge density proﬁle measured by X-mode reﬂectometry and a characteristic cut-off position of the magnetosonic wave. We show that the edge density is not only a function of the average density but also depends in a complex way, on various edge plasma regimes, the power deposition, or the kind of limiter materials or divertor perturbation used to control the edge. Over a large variety of plasma edge regimes, it is shown how the distance between a characteristic ICRH cut-off density layer and the antenna is the relevant parameter to address the problem of the RF coupling efﬁciency. Simulation of the coupling process with the three-dimensional antenna code Ion Cyclotron ANTenna compares well with RF measurements, provided that the experimental density proﬁles are used in the computations.},

RF breakdown/arcing is a major power-limiting factor in antenna systems used for RF heating and current drive in fusion experiments. The factors that contribute to breakdown include gas pressure, gas type, magnetic field, materials, ultraviolet light, and local plasma density. The effects of these factors on RF breakdown are being studied in a resonant 1/4-wavelength section of vacuum transmission line terminated with an open circuit electrode structure. The electrode structure is designed to determine the role of the RF electric field strength and magnetic field orientation on the breakdown process. Changes in the electrical parameters, such as input impedance and the voltage at the electrodes, are being monitored to detect the breakdown events. Measurements of the light emission prior to and during an arc are also being made. For high vacuum conditions using copper electrodes, bright spots appear on the electrode surfaces prior to a breakdown event. An increase in the RF field results in an arc and a flash of light corresponding to copper line emission (578.2 or 521.8 nm). Analysis of the electrode surfaces show large areas of melting and formation of micron-sized rounded protrusions, especially along the sharp edges of small scratches. An increase in the chamber pressure results in a decrease in the maximum RF electric field that can be sustained without breakdown as the pressure approaches a few mTorr. The breakdown event leads to formation of a plasma in the structure, with light emission corresponding to the particular gas being used. The addition of an external magnetic field causes the formation of a plasma at lower pressures, thus limiting the amount of coupled RF power. The presence of UV light has been found to initiate multipactor under some operating conditions.},

The thermalized population of α-particles is not a serious competitor for power absorption as long as their number density is compatible with maintenance of ignition. By contrast, the energetic slowing down fraction, in spite of its even greater dilution, can absorb from the waves a substantial amount of power at the cyclotron resonance and its harmonics. An extensive exploration both in frequency and in toroidal wavenumbers using the parameters of one of the European versions of DEMO shows that three frequency windows exist in which damping is nevertheless predominantly on the electrons. Designing an antenna capable of shaping the launched spectrum to optimize current drive, however, will not be straightforward. Only in a narrow range when the ﬁrst IC harmonic of tritium is deep inside the plasma on the high-ﬁeld side of the magnetic axis, and that of deuterium and helium is still outside on the low-ﬁeld side, it appears possible to achieve a satisfactory current drive efﬁciency with a conventional multi-strap antenna, preferentially located in the upper part of the vessel. Exploiting the other two windows at quite low and quite high frequencies is either impossible on ﬁrst principles, or will demand novel ideas in antenna design.},

	abstract = {Ion Cyclotron Radio Frequency (ICRF) Heating and Current Drive (H\&CD) is a well established technique of auxiliary heating in present tokamaks, as it features high on-axis heating and current drive efﬁciencies associated with proven and low cost technology. An important limiting factor to the use of ICRF as candidate heating method in a commercial reactor is linked to the evanescence of the fast wave in vacuum and in most of the SOL layer, imposing proximity of the launching structure to the plasma boundary and causing high RF standing and DC rectiﬁed voltages at the plasma periphery, possible voltage breakdowns and enhanced local wall loading. Further to previous work (Bosia et al., Ion Cyclotron and Lower Hybrid Arrays applicable to Current Drive in Fusion Reactors, in: AIP Proc. of 20th Topical Conf on RF Power in plasmas No. 1580, 2013, 215) developing new concepts for Ion Cyclotron and Lower Hybrid Heating \& Current Drive arrays, based on the use of periodic structures, a practical example for an in-blanket IC array for DEMO1 is presented in this study.},

In this method, the complex impedance of each radiating element (Zs) is continuously measured in real time and, during the process of arc extinction, the arc position and complex admittance Ya continuously measured. An load independent arc alarm signal is generated and used to initiate and terminate the suppression routine.},

No restriction in the operational conditions was found to exist for the screenless antenna. A theoretical analysis shows that antenna side limiters are sufficient to protect the antenna conductor from the plasma and that the plasma in front of the antenna can take over the role of the FS without introducing additional losses. The impact of the operation with both antennas on plasma temperature, density, energy, impurities, etc., is discussed in detail. It is found that an antenna pair without shield, but with the antenna feeder area covered, has the same heating efficiency and overall performance as an antenna with FS when ?r phasing is used. In zero phase operation, the antenna with FS performs slightly better. First experiments in which an antenna without shield and without coverage of the antenna feeder area is used are briefly discussed.},

The reduction is observed with a broad range of plasma shapes. In multiple locations of antenna frame, the limiter W source has a minimum when RF image currents are decreased by cancellation of the RF current contributions of the central and the outer straps. In JET with ITER-like wall, ITER-like antenna produces about 20\% less of main chamber radiation and of W content compared to the old A2 antennas, although the effect of the A2 antennas on W content is scattered depending on which antennas are powered. Experiments in JET with trace nitrogen (N2) injection show that a presence of active ICRF antenna close to the midplane injection valve has little effect on the core N content, both in dipole and in -90° phasing. This indicates that the effect of ICRF on impurity transport across the scape-off-layer is small in JET compared to the dominant effect on impurity sources leading to increased impurity levels during ICRF operation.},

	abstract = {Recent achievements in studies of the effects of ICRF (Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequencies) power on the SOL (Scrape-Off Layer) and PWI (Plasma Wall Interactions) in ASDEX Upgrade (AUG), Alcator C-Mod, and JET-ILW are reviewed. Capabilities to diagnose and model the effect of DC biasing and associated impurity production at active antennas and on magnetic field connections to antennas are described. The experiments show that ICRF near-fields can lead not only to E × B convection, but also to modifications of the SOL density, which for Alcator C-Mod are limited to a narrow region near antenna. On the other hand, the SOL density distribution along with impurity sources can be tailored using local gas injection in AUG and JET-ILW with a positive effect on reduction of impurity sources. The technique of RF image current cancellation at antenna limiters was successfully applied in AUG using the 3-strap AUG antenna and extended to the 4-strap Alcator C-Mod field-aligned antenna. Multiple observations confirmed the reduction of the impact of ICRF on the SOL and on total impurity production when the ratio of the power of the central straps to the total antenna power is in the range 0.6 {\textless} Pcen/ Ptotal{\textless} 0.8. Near-field calculations indicate that this fairly robust technique can be applied to the ITER ICRF antenna, enabling the mode of operation with reduced PWI. On the contrary, for the A2 antenna in JET-ILW the technique is hindered by RF sheaths excited at the antenna septum. Thus, in order to reduce the effect of ICRF power on PWI in a future fusion reactor, the antenna design has to be optimized along with design of plasmafacing components.},

The measured reaction of the time-averaged RF current at the antenna limiters to the antenna feeding variations is less sensitive than predicted by the calculations. This is likely to have been caused by temporal and spatial fluctuations in the 3D plasma density distribution affected by local non-linear interactions. The 3-strap antenna with the W-coated limiters produces drastically less W sputtering compared to the W-coated 2-strap antennas. This is consistent with the non-linear asymptotic SSWICH-SW calculations for RF sheaths.},

The ion cyclotron range of frequency (ICRF) system is a promising candidate given decades of proven operational experience and low price equipment up to the MW level. ICRF antenna is presently situated in a port of limited size in the vacuum vessel (VV), which may be accompanied with operational limitations in DEMO, primarily because such conﬁgurations present high power density structures that can undergo malfunctions for the power levels anticipated for DEMO, because of voltage stand-off limitations. To mitigate this, a novel ICRF antenna is under development and consists of toroidally distributed identical radiating straps integrated inside the blanket First Wall. Given the antenna concept novelty and the strict requirements on the performance of DEMO, substantial design and integration efforts are needed.

	abstract = {In the framework of the Ion Cyclotron (IC) antenna design, ITER Organization requested qualification tests on sliding Radio-Frequency (RF) contacts, to verify that these contacts (quality class 1) are designed appropriately to guarantee a sufficient operational life time. These RF contacts will be integrated into the antenna structure at different locations to facilitate the assembly and decouple the different mechanical parts. This design will in addition lower the thermo-mechanical constraints and allow radial shimming of the antenna front face. As commercial contacts were not suitable for the ITER ICRH antenna operation, substantial efforts have been made on mechanical design of the new RF contact. Two prototypes have been manufactured and delivered to CEA for testing. In parallel a test stand facility (TITAN) has been refurbished to provide a way to test these RF contacts in relevant conditions (2.25kA @ 62.5MHz, vacuum pressure {\textless}10-3Pa, 1000s). This paper reports on main results we get during the commissioning of the test stand facility. Roadmap of the tests is also detailed with RF power tests for long shot duration (1000s) under vacuum and extensive sliding tests in order to assess the reliability of the RF contact for a relevant life time duration (specified to 10 years). A description of the RF contact is also given with the latest results on the manufacturing process (copper and gold plating and brazing, general assembly).},

The embedded RF contact within the ITER ICRH antenna appeared as a critical component for antenna performance, requiring extensive R\&D. Therefore, CEA has proposed and subsequently prepared a platform to test and validate the anticipated RF contact. A steady state resonator with active water cooling has been manufactured and assembled within the TITAN facility, including a hot pressurized water loop. The program consists of testing the contact at 2.25 kA and 62 MHz in steady state conditions.

This paper reports on the load resilience properties of the antenna prototype, as well as the RF modeling and the commissioning. Signiﬁcant effort on modeling, coupled to an extensive low power campaign, has allowed characterization of the antenna in both vacuum and plasma loading conditions. Plasma load modelings computed with the code TOPICA – very helpful to set up the matching points on plasmas – are found to be in good agreement with the experimental results.

Supersonic molecular beam injection (SMBI), able to launch a series of very short/dense gas jets at Mach number up to 5, was used to mimic the sudden increases of the antenna coupling provoked by ELMs. The results are found to be in good agreement with RF circuit calculations that include 3D modeling.},

Typically, only the first few millimetres of the edge plasma are important in determining coupling. The major implications of the problem of coupling to an overdense plasma can be derived from a simple impedance-matching argument.

	abstract = {The first experimental tests on the Lower Hybrid (LH) launcher similar to that foreseen for ITER have been carried out successfully on the FTU tokamak. The design of this antenna, called PAM (Passive Active Multijunction), developed in cooperation with the EURATOM-CEA association since several years, fulfils the following requests. 1) It can operate in the full shadow of the vessel port to avoid damage from the large particle flow inside the scrape-off layer (SOL) plasma. 2) It can tolerate the heating due to the perpendicular energy and neutron fluxes; 3) It preserves a level of power handling and current drive (CD) efficiency acceptable for ITER. Points 1 and 3 imply solving the problem of good power coupling to the main plasma in conditions of almost vanishing plasma in front of the grill. The proposal was to locate cooling ducts in between the LH fed waveguides in the final part of the launcher, except at the front end, where the usual periodicity of a multijunction (MJ) is restored by interposing passive waveguides between the active ones [1]. In this way the N{\textbar} {\textbar} spectrum (N{\textbar} {\textbar} is the parallel index of refraction) and hence the CD performances can be made similar to a usual MJ, provided a strong cross coupling exists between the active and passive waveguides.

This theory results in the efficient numerical code which is appropriate for the study of the nonlinear response of the plasma ill front of the grill. Both the infinite conventional grill and the structure built up from the infinite series of identical N-waveguide multijunction sections are investigated. It is proved that the spectrum of the last structure is the superposition of N spectra of the infinite conventional grills with the specially selected phase shifts. The theoretical results for three long structures (24-waveguide conventional grill on ASDEX and two multijunction arrays, namely a 32-waveguide grill on JET and a 30-waveguide grill proposed for T15) are compared with the predictions of the theory for the corresponding infinite structures. and the agreement is good.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The role of electron Landau damping (ELD) in the lower hybrid resonance region is reviewed. First, it is shown that good matching of waves with parallel index n∥ large enough for efficient ELD from a finite-length antenna is possible only if the antenna is facing a tenuous plasma such that . This situation appears to prevail in recent experiments using phased waveguide arrays as launching structures. Moreover, it is shown that the relevant portion of the spectrum will be depleted by linear wave transformation before suffering appreciable ELD, unless the frequency is at least 1.5 times higher than the resonant frequency in the core of the plasma. Thus, in the case of a phased waveguide array designed for efficient ion heating in the resonance region, hardly more than a few per cent of the power will be absorbed by the electrons through ELD. On the other hand, provided that the antenna design is appropriate, ELD itself can be regarded as a simple and efficient method of heating large plasmas up to thermonuclear temperatures.},

To find the reflection and transmission coefficients, as well as the k‖-spectrum of the excited field, the waveguide field, represented as a superposition of eigenmodes, is matched to the field in the plasma, which is evaluated on the assumption of a linear density profile near the plasma edge. It is found that the reflection coefficient can be made acceptably low and is not sensitively dependent on the plasma parameters.

The time evolution of the distribution functions of the heated species is determined by the balance between the wave-particle interactions and the Coulomb collisions. The ion cyclotron heating can produce highly anisotropic velocity distributions with large energetic tails. The orbits of these high energy ions will experience large deviations from the magnetic ﬂux surfaces. The transfer of toroidal momentum from the wave will give rise to a spatial inward or outward induced transport of the high energy ions depending of the toroidal direction of wave propagation. Further, the wave propagation and damping properties are determinated by the details of the distribution functions. Hence, both the Fokker-Planck equation of the distribution function and the wave equation have to be solved self-consistently.},

After more than 70 years of research, despite great progress, the goal has not been realized. Do you have to be crazy to love quests like this? Not really, but you do have to have an unshakeable optimism. Through humorous anecdotes, and accessible yet detailed scientific discussion, this book illuminates the enjoyment of scientific research through an account of fifty years working on fusion energy development. The anecdotes bring out the human side of research, in which innovative and sometimes egocentric scientists create both clever and nutty experiments. Among the many stories within are witchcraft at Harwell, shocking experiences, entertaining talks, and the wit of top scientists such as Marshall Rosenbluth. Above all the book highlights the significant advances made in developing practical fusion energy and the promise for an exciting future with the National Ignition Facility and International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor. This book will be of interest to physicists as well as other students and researchers in the scientific and wider communities. Shows the exciting and fun aspects of science research. Author has spent 54 years working in the area, offering key insights on the history of fusion. Clear, detailed explanations of fusion energy are supplied, helping non-science readers understand the area.--},

This was achieved by implementing the scattering matrix formalism. The extended code is still computationally fast by the use of 2D splining of the plasma surface admittance in the accessibility region of the k−space, by the use of high order Gaussian quadrature rules for the integration of the coupling elements and by the application of the symmetry rules of the coupling elements for the multiperiodic structures. We successfully benchmark the coupling of the C3 and C4 launchers as determined OLGA with the 1D ALOHA results for several plasma conﬁguration derived from reﬂectometric and interferometeric measurement of the density proﬁle during a TORE SUPRA discharge. We found that OLGA and ALOHA gives the same results for the case of supercritical plasma density at the grill mouth. For subcritical densities in the front of grill ALOHA results are unreliable.},

	abstract = {Geometric calculus and the calculus of diﬀerential forms have common origins in Grassmann algebra but diﬀerent lines of historical development, so mathematicians have been slow to recognize that they belong together in a single mathematical system. This paper reviews the rationale for embedding diﬀerential forms in the more comprehensive system of Geometric Calculus. The most signiﬁcant application of the system is to relativistic physics where it is referred to as Spacetime Calculus. The fundamental integral theorems are discussed along with applications to physics, especially electrodynamics.},

Les scénarios où le profil de courant est modifié de façon stationnaire à travers le courant non-inductif généré par les ondes hybrides sont d'un intérêt particulier. Un nouveau système de contrôle a été développé pour le tokamak Tore Supra et a rendu possible un grand nombre de nouveaux scénarios de fonctionnement . Dans une des expériences décrites, on se place dans une situation où le système poloïdal n'échange plus d'énergie avec le plasma et c'est la puissance de l'onde qui contrôle le courant.

Even with no current load, voltage withstand can be compromised when contacts are simply closed and then reopened, through cold weld effects and mechanical disturbance of the interrupter. For contacts carrying high current when closed, additional effects associated with Joule heating at the contact interface become important while interruption at both low and high currents substantially broaden the range of physical phenomena contributing to dielectric failure. More generally, any of the principal components of interrupter construction, i.e. contact supports, contacts, shields, and envelope, as well as the motion and force imparted to the moving contact, can limit significantly the withstand capability of interrupting devices. Further limitations of electrical performance are imposed by particle effects. This paper reviews such phenomena.},

	abstract = {Since the mission of Tore Supra is to produce quasisteady-state discharges, the lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) system constitutes the most important method of additional heating and noninductive current drive. A description of the LHCD system is given, including the different launcher designs developed for the Tore Supra long-pulse program. Following the completion of the Composants Internes et Limiteur project, together with the installation of a high-performance LHCD launcher, world record discharges, injected and extracted energy exceeding 1 GJ, were obtained in 2003. With the flexibility of lower hybrid (LH) waves to tailor the current profile, an enhanced performance regime, the so-called LHEP, has been maintained in quasi-steady-state discharges. Detailed measurements of the fast electron distribution have allowed us to constrain LHCD ray-tracing models and to quantify parametric dependencies describing the fast electron tail. Localized heat loads on the LHCD launchers due to interaction with fast particles have been measured and quantified, using infrared imaging and calorimetric measurements on water-cooled plasma facing components. Furthermore, experimental results in the area of LH wave coupling are presented.},

	abstract = {A new ITER-relevant lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) launcher, based on the passive-active-multijunction (PAM) concept, was brought into operation on the Tore Supra tokamak in autumn 2009. The PAM launcher concept was designed in view of ITER to allow efﬁcient cooling of the waveguides, as required for long pulse operation. In addition, it offers low power reﬂection close to the cut-off density, which is very attractive for ITER, where the large distance between the plasma and the wall may bring the density in front of the launcher to low values. The ﬁrst experimental campaign on Tore Supra has shown extremely encouraging results in terms of reﬂected power level and power handling. Power reﬂection coefﬁcient {\textless}2\% is obtained at low density in front of the launcher, i.e. close to the cut-off density, and very good agreement between the experimental results and the coupling code predictions is obtained. Long pulse operation at ITER-relevant power density has been demonstrated. The maximum power and energy reached so far is 2.7 MW during 78 s, corresponding to a power density of 25 MW m−2, i.e. its design value at f = 3.7 GHz. In addition, 2.7 MW has been coupled at a plasma–launcher distance of 10 cm, with a power reﬂection coefﬁcient {\textless}2\%. Finally, full non-inductive discharges have been sustained for 50 s with the PAM.},

The current drive efficiency is found to be lower than in Tore Supra, which could probably be due to high Zeff and non-optimised coupling conditions, the latter of which could be improved by operating at higher plasma density, using local gas injection and new improved plasma outer gap control.},

Moreover, cleaning ability of glow discharge was retained in spite of addition of small amounts (up to 6\%) of methane to H2 ﬂow. The high-reﬂective metallic (Al) mirrors with protective oxide (ZrO2 or Al2O3) layer demonstrated high stability of reﬂective spectra during the deposition–erosion treatment.

In order to achieve the conditions similar to those expected in an electricity-generating fusion power plant, plasmas with a temperature of several hundreds of millions of degrees must be generated and sustained for long periods. For this purpose, RF antennas delivering multi-megawatts of power to magnetized confined plasma are commonly used in experimental tokamaks. In the gigahertz range of frequencies, high power phased arrays known as “Lower Hybrid” (LH) antennas are used to extend the plasma duration. This paper reviews some of the technological aspects of the LH antennas used in the Tore Supra tokamak and presents the current design of a proposed 20 MW LH system for the international experiment ITER.},

	abstract = {Lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) is an attractive option for non-inductive tokamak operation due to its high current drive efﬁciency and ability to drive current off axis. The parameters of the Alcator C-Mod LHCD system (f0 = 4.6 GHz, Bφ 5.5 T, n¯e 1020 m−3) are similar to the proposed LHCD system on ITER. This paper will describe improvements in LHCD technology on C-Mod designed to increase single-pass absorption at high n¯e, extend pulse length (to {\textgreater}3 s), and increase power delivered to the plasma (to ∼2 MW). Modelling of lower hybrid (LH) wave propagation indicates that the observed loss of LHCD efﬁciency at higher n¯e can be mitigated by enhancing the single pass power absorption through use of an off mid-plane launcher. The four rows of the launcher are located above the mid-plane (with Ip and Bφ both clockwise viewing from the top down) in order to exploit the poloidal upshift of n as rays propagate from the antenna into the plasma. The transmitter protection system (TPS) was redesigned to model the coolant temperature in real time and shut off the klystron beam voltage if the coolant is close to boiling. The TPS upgrade has been installed and operated on C-Mod for pulses up to 4.5 s into dummy loads and 1.0 s into the plasma. A new movable local LH launcher protection limiter was designed to reduce reﬂection coefﬁcients across a wide range of launcher positions. Finally, a high power waveguide double-stub tuner is under development to provide feedback controlled load matching to reduce power reﬂected from the antenna under poor coupling conditions.},

Bremsstrahlung emission from relativistic fast electrons in the core plasma drops suddenly above line averaged densities of 1020 m−3 (ω/ωLH ∼ 3) in single null discharges with large ({\textgreater} 10 mm) plasma–inner wall gaps, well below the density limit previously observed on limited tokamaks (ω/ωLH ∼ 2). Modeling and experimental evidence suggest that the absence of LHCD driven fast electrons at high density may be due to parasitic collisional absorption in the scrape oﬀ layer. Experiments show that the population of fast electrons produced by LHCD at high density (n¯e {\textgreater} m−3) can be increased signiﬁcantly by operating with a plasma–inner wall gap of less than ∼ 5 mm with the strongest non-thermal emission in inner-wall limited plasmas. A change in plasma topology from single to double null produces a modest increase in non-thermal emission at high density. Increasing the electron temperature in the periphery of the plasma (0.8 {\textgreater} r/a {\textgreater} 1.0) also results in a modest increase in non-thermal electron emission above the density limit.},

	abstract = {Launching of the fast wave in the lower hybrid frequency range is described. This wave is excited at the plasma edge by RF electric fields perpendicular to those required for the lower hybrid wave. In high-temperature plasmas, where the lower hybrid wave may not penetrate because of Landau damping or other effects near the edge, the fast wave might provide an alternative for heating and/or current generation in the central portion of the plasma. In addition, for high-density plasmas, this has the advantage that lower frequencies than those required for the lower hybrid excitation can be used. Thus waveguides of convenient dimensions for maximum power transmission and ease of fabrication can be employed. Coupling from a waveguide array into an inhomogeneous plasma is analysed. The model is infinite in y, the direction perpendicular to magnetic field and density gradient. Power reflection in the waveguides is found as a function of array design and density gradient at the edge. This reflection is fairly large ({\textgreater} 20\%). Propagation into the plasma is then considered, and the field structure and dispersion of the fast waves are found as functions of the distance of penetration. Unlike the lower hybrid waves, fast waves do not form resonance cones and energy is dispersed over a large volume.},

The new LHCD launcher (LH2) is based on a novel splitter concept which evenly distributes the microwave power in four ways in the poloidal direction. This design allows for simpliﬁcation of the feeding structure while keeping the ﬂexibility to vary the peak launched toroidal index of refraction, Ntoroidal, from −3.8 to 3.8. An integrated model predicts good plasma coupling over a wide range of edge densities, while poloidal variations of the edge density are found to affect the evenness of power splitting in the poloidal direction. The measured transmission loss is about 30\% lower than the previous launcher, and a clean Ntoroidal spectrum has been conﬁrmed. Power handling capability exceeding an empirical weak conditioning limit and reliable operation up to 1.1 MW net LHCD power have been achieved. A survey of antenna–plasma coupling shows the existence of a millimetric vacuum gap in front of the launcher. Fully non-inductive, reversed shear plasma operation has been demonstrated and sustained for multiple current diffusion times. The current drive efﬁciency, ηLH ≡ neR0Ip/PLH, of these plasmas is (0.2–0.25) × 1020 m−2A W−1, which is in agreement with the expected efﬁciency on the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER).},

	abstract = {The design, construction, and initial results of a new LH launcher (LH2) on Alcator C-Mod is presented. LH2 is based on a novel four way splitter concept which evenly splits the microwave power in four ways in the poloidal direction. This design allows the simpliﬁcation of feeding structure, while keeping the ﬂexibility to vary the peak launched toroidal spectrum from -3.8 to 3.8. Good plasma coupling over a wide range of edge densities and a clean spectrum were predicted by an integrated model using TOPLHA and CST microwave studio, in which the antenna plasma coupling problem and the vacuum side EM problem were solved self-consistently. Poloidal variations of the edge density were found to aﬀect mainly the evenness of power splitting in the poloidal direction. In order to characterize the coupling performance, LH2 is equipped with a variety of dedicated diagnostics such as 16 sets of RF probes, six Langmuir probes, and three X-mode reﬂectometer horns. LH2 was successfully commissioned in July 2010 including these dedicated diagnostics. The measured transmission loss is about 30 \% lower than the previous launcher and the clean spectrum has been conﬁrmed. The power handling capability exceeding an empirical weak conditioning limit was demonstrated, and so far, the reliable operation upto 0.8 MW net LHCD power has been achieved.},

	abstract = {The results and interpretation of the modest-power ({\textasciitilde} 90 kW) lower-hybrid-heating experiment on Alcator A are presented. The expected results from linear waveguide-plasma coupling theory are outlined, and the possible effects of parametric instabilities, scattering from density fluctuations, and imperfect energetic ion confinement are addressed. It is found experimentally that good coupling and the absence of RF breakdown are achieved with a double waveguide array at available RF power densities P R F {\textasciicircum} 4 . 5 kW\#cnf2, the waveguide vacuum windows being outside the toroidal field magnets; a waveguide array having vacuum windows near the waveguide mouth so that the co = coce layer can be pressurized shows no breakdown at P R P {\textgreater} 8 kW/cm2 when a single waveguide is energized. Energetic ion production and a factor-of-50 increase in the fusion neutron rate are observed to take place at well defined values of central plasma density; below these densities electron heating occurs. The ion tail production is found to be independent of the relative phase of the double waveguide array employed. This ion heating occurs at a lower density than theoretically expected; together with the electron heating this indicates waves having rift— 5 being absorbed near the plasma centre. Probes at the plasma edge observe a frequency-down-shifted and broadened RF pump signal that is strongly attenuated as the plasma density increases through the neutron production band. These anomalous heating results and probe signals can be explained by a parametric decay of the pump wave into higher-nn lower hybrid waves near the plasma edge. An alternate qualitative explanation would be the poloidal scattering of the lower hybrid waves at the plasma periphery due to density fluctuations; the nn of the scattered lower hybrid waves would then increase as they propagated inward because of magnetic shear. The neutron rate decay times imply that the RF creates ion tails having a substantial fraction of their energy above 50 keV. The neutron decay times and rates strongly depend on plasma current and indicate the expected influence of ion confinement on RF heating efficiencies. Finally, the RF heating efficiencies are assessed.},

	abstract = {A prototype passive active multijunction (PAM) launcher for lower hybrid (LH) waves conceptually similar to that foreseen for ITER has been successfully tested on FTU at frequency f = 8 GHz. The power routinely and safely managed for the maximum time allowed by the LH power plant (0.9 s) without any fault in the transmission lines is 250 kW, corresponding to 75 MW m−2 across the antenna active area and very close to the design value of 270 kW or 80 MW m−2. The achieved value is at least 1.4 times larger than the ITER request, which would be only 52 MW m−2, if the 33 MW m−2 required to the ITER grill in order to couple 20 MW to the plasma, are scaled up linearly with f , from fITER = 5 GHz. This linear scaling of the power handling capability of the LH antennae is indeed conservative with respect to the available data. The test results validate also the other two main expectations relevant to ITER, foreseen by the codes, namely to operate with the grill entirely in the vessel shadow and to still preserve good current drive (CD) efﬁciency. Even with the grill mouth retracted 2 mm inside the port shadow and with density in front of the launcher very close or even lower than the cut-off value, the PAM reﬂection coefﬁcient is always 2.5\%, if the antenna has been properly conditioned. The CD efﬁciency is comparable to that of a conventional grill, once the lower directivity is taken into account. Flexibility in determining the N{\textbar}{\textbar} spectrum is also maintained, according to hard x-rays and electron cyclotron emission spectra. Conditioning the PAM in order to operate at the ITER equivalent power level required only one day of radio-frequency operation, without a previous baking of the waveguides.},

In this paper, these results are extended to the slow-wave case when nz{\textgreater} the refractive index in the static magnetic field direction, exceeds unity. It is found that the plasma is indeed accessible to the slow waves if Golant's accessibility criterion n z {\textgreater} 1 + ( w /w )2 is satisfied.

If, as was pointed out by Glagolev, propagation from the plasma edge to the hybrid layer is not materially affected by the inclusion of finite-temperature effects, by far the most elegant solution (with potential application to thermonuclear plasmas) for coupling r.f. energy from the second to the twentieth ion-cyclotron harmonic waves is by launching TEM-like waves in the coaxial waveguide formed by the plasma columnand the containing walls.},

	abstract = {To achieve steady-state operation on future fusion devices, in particular on ITER, the coupling of the lower hybrid wave must be optimized on a wide range of edge conditions. However, under some speciﬁc conditions, deleterious effects on the lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) coupling are sometimes observed on Tore Supra. In this way, dedicated LHCD experiments have been performed using the LHCD system of Tore Supra, composed of two different conceptual designs of launcher: the fully active multi-junction (FAM) and the new passive active multijunction (PAM) antennas. A non-linear interaction between the electron density and the electric ﬁeld has been characterized in a thin plasma layer in front of the two LHCD antennas. The resulting dependence of the power reﬂection coefﬁcient (RC) with the LHCD power is not predicted by the standard linear theory of the LH wave coupling. A theoretical model is suggested to describe the non-linear wave–plasma interaction induced by the ponderomotive effect and implemented in a new full wave LHCD code, PICCOLO-2D (ponderomotive effect in a coupling code of lower hybrid wave-2D). The code self-consistently treats the wave propagation in the antenna vicinity and its interaction with the local edge plasma density. The simulation reproduces very well the occurrence of a non-linear behaviour in the coupling observed in the LHCD experiments. The important differences and trends between the FAM and the PAM antennas, especially a larger increase in RC for the FAM, are also reproduced by the PICCOLO-2D simulation. The working hypothesis of the contribution of the ponderomotive effect in the non-linear observations of LHCD coupling is therefore validated through this comprehensive modelling for the ﬁrst time on the FAM and PAM antennas on Tore Supra.},

	abstract = {A new concept of lower hybrid antenna for current drive has been proposed for ITER (Bibet et al 1995 Nucl. Fusion 35 1213–23): the passive active multijunction (PAM) antenna that relies on a periodic combination of active and passive waveguides. An actively cooled PAM antenna at 3.7 GHz has recently been installed on the tokamak Tore Supra. This paper summarizes the comprehensive experimental characterization of the coupling properties of the PAM antenna to the Tore Supra plasmas. In this paper, the electromagnetic properties of the antenna are measured at a reduced power ({\textless}1 MW) to allow a systematic comparison with linear wave coupling theory and the associated modelling based on the linear ALOHA code. In a wide range of edge electron densities at the antenna aperture (spanning a factor 20 from 0.5 × nc to 10 × nc where nc is the slow wave density cut-off, nc = 1.7 × 1017 m−3 at 3.7 GHz) and antenna phasing, the ALOHA simulations reproduce the experimental results observed on Tore Supra. In addition, reduced power reﬂection coefﬁcients ({\textless}5\%) are measured at a low edge density, close to nc, i.e. in the range 0.5–3 × nc. Measurement and analysis with ALOHA of the antenna–plasma scattering matrices provide explanation of the good coupling properties of the PAM antenna close to nc by highlighting the crucial role of the slow wave intercoupling between active and passive waveguides through the plasma edge. This detailed validation of the coupling modelling is an important step towards the validation of the PAM concept in view of further optimizing the electromagnetic properties of the future ITER antenna.},

This has been demonstrated both analytically and numerically by the results obtained for the four-waveguide grill designed for a small tokamak. It has been shown that the current drive efficiency (or the directivity) can reach 50\% for practically arbitrary A{\textless}f{\textgreater} (?* 0°, 180°), if Lg is properly chosen. The enhanced current drive efficiency at A{\textless}/{\textgreater} * 90° follows from an uneven power distribution among the separate waveguides and from the self-adaptive adjustment of the phases of the incident waves. The risk of power overloading of the waveguides increases with decreasing OQ. A short description of the author's variant of the theory of wave diffraction on the junction is also given. Good agreement between the simple analytic model and the numerical solutions is demonstrated.},

	abstract = {Lower hybrid (LH) waves are very important for heating and current drive in tokamaks. Phased arrays of rectangular waveguides, generally called grills, are typically used as launchers. We develop a code which solves, in the 3D geometry of the grill structure, the problem of efﬁcient coupling: the power density spectrum of the emitted waves, the power reﬂection coefﬁcient, the power lost by the waves launched in the inaccessible region and the directivity of the waves transmitted into the accessible region. The code is also able to determine the 3D electric ﬁeld in front of the grill. An efﬁcient adaptive full wave solver is used to determine the wave propagation in a 1D plasma slab geometry. To evaluate the very large number of 2D k-space inﬁnite integrals for the coupling elements, we have developed a method based on high order Gaussian quadratures combined with 2D B-splines in the accessible region for the plasma related part of the integrands. This method is well suited to handle large structures and many modes because the computational time is only weakly dependent on the size of the problem. An iterative evaluation of the integrands in the inaccessible region is adopted to handle the presently overlooked near singular behaviour of the integrands as well as the spectral power density associated with the eigenmodes. The role of collisions is clariﬁed in this context.},

The thermal measurements have been compared to ﬁnite elements calculations with the Cast 3M code taking into account the RF losses, the plasma radiated heat ﬂux and an additional heat ﬂux on the antenna and guard limiter surface in front of the plasma.

Using a coordinate system that reﬂects the nested structure of magnetic ﬂux surfaces in tokamaks, fast and accurate calculations inside the plasma separatrix can be performed using analytical derivatives of a spline-Fourier interpolation of the axisymmetric toroidal MHD equilibrium. Applications to reverse ﬁeld pinch magnetic conﬁguration are also included. The effects of 3D perturbations of the axisymmetric toroidal MHD equilibrium, due to the discreteness of the magnetic coil system or plasma ﬂuctuations in an original quasi-optical approach, are also studied.

	abstract = {During tokamak operation with lower hybrid (LH) power a few per cent of the launched power is absorbed by the scrape-off layer plasma in magnetic ﬂux tubes in front of the LH grill. At strike points of these ﬂux tubes, intense plasma–wall interaction is seen in visible and infrared wavelengths, and local wall damage can occur. The parallel power ﬂux within these ‘hot spots’ is estimated to be up to about 10 MW m−2 by infrared imagery. Recent experimental results from retarding ﬁeld analyzer measurements on Tore Supra as well as JET IR camera measurements have shown the existence of fast electrons as far as a few centimeters from the grill mouth. This ﬁnding cannot be explained by the standard theory. We present therefore in this paper a novel theory explaining the fast electron generation in a several cm wide layer in front of the LH grill by taking into account LH wave propagation features closely connected with the blob character of edge turbulence. We demonstrate that the computed power-ﬂows then essentially agree with data from infrared diagnostics. An alternative theoretical explanation considers plasma density modulations due to ponderomotive force effects in front of the LH grill.},

	abstract = {Active current drive with lower hybrid (LH) waves in the advanced scenario plasmas at JET-EFDA was successful after a systematic study of the coupling problems that derive from the H-mode features of the edge plasma, namely very low density and ELM activity. The LH coupling has been improved compared to the past, by making the edge plasma in front of the LH launcher denser and more uniform. Injecting deuterated methane (CD4) from a nearby gas pipe increases the density in front of the LH launcher at least by a factor of 1.5, above the cut-off value for the LH frequency. A better matching of the plasma shape to that of the LH antenna makes the plasma ahead of the LH launcher more regular along the poloidal angle. These two techniques together have permitted a balanced supply of the three LH grills, with an average reﬂection below 4\%, as in the previous L-mode operation. CD4 does not affect the performances nor does it contaminate the main plasma up to the maximum ﬂow rate so far used, CD4 {\textgreater} 1022 el s−1 and now it is routinely applied in JET (up to 4 MW have been injected for longer than 8 s) with very encouraging results for LHCD. Even though CD4 is not suitable for ITER for tritium retention, the possibility of controlling locally and safely the scrape-off plasma density has been demonstrated.},

The KSTAR 5 GHz steady-state LHCD system is being designed to couple an input power of 2 MW for 300 s generated by four 5 GHz klystrons. For the development of this system, there are two critical issues. One is the development of a 5 GHz CW klystron for the RF source of the system. The other is the design of a steadystate LH launcher with active water cooling. In this paper, the current status of the development and design for the KSTAR steady-state LHCD system is described. For the LHCD system, aiming at a basic experimental study of 5 GHz LH wave propagation and operational experience with an LHCD system, the installation of an initial LHCD system with a capacity of 0.5 MW for 2 s is scheduled in 2010 using a 5 GHz prototype klystron and an un-cooled 1 MW launcher. The design and progress for the initial LHCD system are also presented.},

	abstract = {Fully non-inductive operation with lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) in the Tore Supra tokamak is achieved using either a fully active multijunction (FAM) launcher or a more recent ITER-relevant passive active multijunction (PAM) launcher, or both launchers simultaneously. While both antennas show comparable experimental efﬁciencies, the analysis of stability properties in long discharges suggest different current proﬁles. We present comparative modelling of LHCD with the two different launchers to characterize the effect of the respective antenna spectra on the driven current proﬁle. The interpretative modelling of LHCD is carried out using a chain of codes calculating, respectively, the global discharge evolution (tokamak simulator METIS), the spectrum at the antenna mouth (LH coupling code ALOHA), the LH wave propagation (ray-tracing code C3PO), and the distribution function (3D Fokker–Planck code LUKE). Essential aspects of the fast electron dynamics in time, space and energy are obtained from hard x-ray measurements of fast electron bremsstrahlung emission using a dedicated tomographic system. LHCD simulations are validated by systematic comparisons between these experimental measurements and the reconstructed signal calculated by the code R5X2 from the LUKE electron distribution. An excellent agreement is obtained in the presence of strong Landau damping (found under low density and high-power conditions in Tore Supra) for which the ray-tracing model is valid for modelling the LH wave propagation. Two aspects of the antenna spectra are found to have a signiﬁcant effect on LHCD. First, the driven current is found to be proportional to the directivity, which depends upon the respective weight of the main positive and main negative lobes and is particularly sensitive to the density in front of the antenna. Second, the position of the main negative lobe in the spectrum is different for the two launchers. As this lobe drives a counter-current, the resulting driven current proﬁle is also different for the FAM and PAM launchers.},

This equation provides a theoretical framework for a global description of the propagation and absorption of lower hybrid waves (or any weakly damped small wavelength mode) in present-day Tokamaks. Resonant toroidal couplings between the unperturbed cylindrical modes are the basic processes involved in this description. They lead to the destruction of correlations above a stochasticity threshold for the toroidal perturbation. A general method for computing the coupling coefficients is proposed and applied under typical current generation conditions. This normal mode energy diffusion provides a simple theory to address the so-called “spectral gap” problem.},

This modular conﬁguration has given the possibility of testing on FTU a classical multijunction (MJ) and a passive active multijunction (PAM) that is considered as a privileged candidate for the LH launcher for ITER. The tests have conﬁrmed the good coupling properties of the MJ with plasma densities lower than those normally acceptable for a CG, but at expenses of a reduced power directivity and ﬂexibility in N . The PAM, with a small reduction on power directivity and ﬂexibility in N with reference to the MJ, has shown an efﬁcient coupling when working close to cut-off density (0.8 × 1018 m−3) ﬂush to the ﬁrst wall, a relatively quiet region in the harsh plasma environment of ITER.

	abstract = {The new Alcator C-Mod LHCD system (LH2) is based on the concept of a four way splitter [1] which evenly splits the RF power among the four waveguides that compose one of the 16 columns of the LH grill. In this work several simulation tools have been used to study the LH2 coupling performance and the launched spectra when facing a plasma, numerically verifying the effectiveness of the four way splitter concept and further improving its design. The TOPLHA code has been used for modeling reﬂections at the antenna/plasma interface. TOPLHA results have been then coupled to the commercial code CST Microwave Studio to efﬁciently optimize the four way splitter geometry for several plasma scenarios. Subsequently, the COMSOL Multiphysics code has been used to self consistently take into account the electromagnetic-thermal-structural interactions. This comprehensive and predictive analysis has proven to be very valuable for understanding the behavior of the system when facing the plasma and has profoundly inﬂuenced several design choices of the LH2. According to the simulations, the ﬁnal design ensures even poloidal power splitting for a wide range of plasma parameters, which ultimately results in an improvement of the wave coupling and an increased maximum operating power.},

	abstract = {A 20 MW Lower Hybrid Current Drive system using an antenna based on the Passive-Active Multijunction (PAM) concept is envisaged on ITER. This paper gives an overview of the mechanical analysis, modeling and design carried out on two major elements of the antenna: the grill front face, and the RF feed-through or windows. The front face will have to withstand high heat and fast neutrons ﬂuxes directly from the plasma. It will be actively cooled and present a beryllium coating upon ITER requirement. The RF window being a critical safety importance class component (SIC) because of its tritium conﬁnement function, two of them will be put in series on each line to achieve a double barrier. A design of a water cooled 5 GHz CW RF “pillbox” window capable of sustaining 500 kW of transmitted power is proposed. Both studies allow to move forward, and focus on critical issues, such as manufacturing processes and R\&D associated programs including tests of mock-ups.},

	abstract = {A 3.7 GHz mock-up antenna module using carbon ﬁber composite (CFC) was fabricated and tested for the development of a heat-resistive front of the lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) antenna. This module has four waveguides and a water cooling channel, the length is 206 mm. The CFC surface was coated with a thin titanium layer and was plated with copper in order to reduce RF losses, to bond rods and septum plates and to assemble them with cooling channel. The RF losses and the outgassing rates of this CFC module at high RF power were measured during long pulses. When the injected power varies between 30 and 100 kW, the RF losses measured by calorimetery, were found to be in the range of 1.0–1.2\%. It is found that this experimental value is 2.5 – 3.0 times higher than the theoretical value of pure copper. Stationary operation of the CFC module with water cooling is performed at the RF power density of 45 MW m−2 during 1000 s. The outgassing rates from the CFC module are in the range of 0.93 1.3 × 10−6 Pam−3 s−1 m−2 at the module temperature of 120°C, it is low enough for an antenna material. No signiﬁcant bonding defects occurred during the steady-state operation. It is assessed that a CFC module is an attractive candidate for a heat-resistive front of LHCD antenna. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The numerical model whose generality allows to study the effect of various types of fluctuations, including those with short characteristic wavelengths is validated against a coupling code in quiescent regimes. When electron density fluctuations along the toroidal direction are incorporated in the dielectric tensor over a thin perturbed layer in front of the grill, the power spectrum may be strongly modified from the antenna mouth to the plasma separatrix as the LH wave propagates. The diffraction effect by density fluctuations leads to the appearance of multiple satellite lobes with randomly varying positions and the averaged perturbation is found to be maximum for the Fourier components of the fluctuating spectrum in the vicinity of the launched LH wavelength. This highlights that fast toroidal inhomogeneities with short characteristics length scales in front of the grill may change significantly the initial LH power spectrum used in coupled ray-tracing and Fokker–Planck calculations.},

A new multijunction launcher is being prepared to improve the efficiency more. The launcher is featured by 4x4 multijunction modules, each of which is composed of 12 sub-waveguides and a oversized waveguide. The RF power in the module is divided into 12 at a junction point in the toroidal direction. This design makes the launcher structure very simple. The RF properties of a prototype module are studied by using dummy loads. It is shown that the phasing and power dividing rate are well explained by the scattering matrix method, when the reflection coefficient of sub-waveguides is less than -10\%. This launcher is expected to improve current drive efficiency 20-30\% compared with the previous JT-60 LHCD multijunction launcher. This launcher will be operated at the beginning of 1993.},

These launchers are based on the ‘multijunction’ principle which allows them to be quite compact and is therefore attractive for the design of efficient multi-megawatt antennas in NETIITER. Extensive coupling measurements have been performed in order to study the radiofrequency (RF) characteristics of the plasma loaded antennas. Measurements of the plasma scattering coefficients of the antennas show good agreement with those obtained from the linear coupling theory (SWAN code). Global reflection coefficients of a few per cent have been measured in a large range of edge plasma densities (0.3 X 10” m-3 I neg I 1.4 X 10l8m-3) or antenna positions (0.02-0.05 m from the plasma edge) and up to a maximum injected RF power density of 45 MWlm’. When the plasma is pushed against the inner wall of the chamber, the reflection coefficient is found to remain low up to distances of the order of 0.10 m. The coupling measurements allow us to deduce the ‘experimental’ power spectra radiated by the antennas when all their modules are fed simultaneously with variable phases. Thus, the multijunction launcher is assessed as a viable antenna for high power transmission with good coupling characteristics and spectrum control.},

The result of the simulations of the electric ﬁeld shows that the power capacity of the multi-stepped structure is more than twice compared with the traditional design. Moreover, the divider shows excellent performance in the low-power test, with low return loss (−35 dB) and similar division ratio (S21 = −3.004 dB and S31 = −3.035 dB) at 4.6 GHz.

The FFT will be computer controlled and must react to matching a load in a few hundred microseconds. This puts a severe requirement on power supply response time and its variation.

	abstract = {Recent studies at JET focus on analysis of the lower hybrid (LH) wave power absorption and current drive (CD) calculations by means of a new ray tracing (RT)/Fokker–Planck (FP) package. The RT code works in real 2D geometry accounting for the plasma boundary and the launcher shape. LH waves with different parallel refractive index, N∥, spectra in poloidal direction can be launched thus simulating authentic antenna spectrum with rows fed by different combinations of klystrons. Various FP solvers were tested most advanced of which is a relativistic bounce averaged FP code. LH wave power deposition profiles from the new RT/FP code were compared to the experimental results from electron cyclotron emission (ECE) analysis of pulses at 3.4 T low and high density. This kind of direct comparison between power deposition profiles from experimental ECE data and numerical model were carried out for the first time for waves in the LH range of frequencies. The results were in a reasonable agreement with experimental data at lower density, line averaged values of n→e ≈ 2.4 × 1019 m−3. At higher density, n→e ≈ 3 × 1019 m−3, the code predicted larger on-axis LH power deposition, which is inconsistent with the experimental observations. Both calculations were unable to produce LH wave absorption at the plasma periphery, which contradicts to the analysis of the ECE data and possible sources of these discrepancies have been briefly discussed in the paper. The code was also used to calculate the LH power deposition and CD profiles for the low-density preheat phase of JET’s advanced tokamak (AT) scenario. It was found that as the density evolves from hollow to flat and then to a more peaked profile the LH power and driven current move inward i.e. towards the plasma axis. A total driven current of about 70 kA for 1 MW of launched LH power was predicted in these conditions.},

	abstract = {In this paper important aspects of Lower Hybrid (LH) operation with the ITER Like Wall (ILW) [1] at JET are reported. Impurity release during LH operation was investigated and it was found that there is no significant Be increase with LH power. Concentration of W was analysed in more detail and it was concluded that LH contributes negligibly to its increase. No cases of W accumulation in LH-only heating experiments were observed so far. LH wave coupling was studied and optimised to achieve the level of system performance similar to before ILW installation. Measurements by Li-beam were used to study systematic dependencies of the SOL density on the gas injection rate from a dedicated gas introduction module and the LH power and launcher position. Experimental results are supported by SOL transport modelling. Observations of arcs in front of the LH launcher and hotspots on magnetically connected sections of the vessel are reported. Overall, a relatively troublefree operation of the LH system up to 2.5MW of coupled Radio Frequency (RF) power in L-mode plasma was achieved with no indication that the power cannot be increased further.},

	abstract = {In this study, a klystron for the KSTAR lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) system was developed as a prototype for a 5 GHz, 500 kW CW operation that is aimed to meet the requirement of the ITER LHCD system as well. Before the 2012 KSTAR campaign, the prototype klystron was validated only for 350 kW CW operation. The weakest part of the klystron for 500 kW CW operation was the RF output window failure due to a thermal stress caused by the temperature gradient. The klystron was equipped with two RF windows, each of which should transmit 250 kW power. Prior to the full performance test of the klystron, the performance of the test RF windows that were identical to those mounted on the klystron was tested with half of the klystron’s full power. The temperature increase in the test RF windows was monitored using an IR camera. The temperature diﬀerence, ΔTce, between the center and edge of the test window at 250-kW 1000-s transmitting power was predicted to be 23 °C, which is smaller than the safe ΔTce, which is 50 °C according to the manufacturer. Based on the result of the test window measurement, 500-kW 1000-s operation of the klystron was conducted successfully. The klystron output power characteristics depending on the phase of load reﬂection VSWR 1.4:1 were investigated. The klystron generated stable power on a load VSWR of 1.4:1 at various phases. The output power at the worst phase was 380 kW. Details of the IR-imaging setup are discussed and the results obtained are presented.},

	abstract = {A prototype of a midplane passive active multijunction (PAM) antenna was fabricated for the lower hybrid current drive system of KSTAR. The antenna includes a PAM launcher, bidirectional couplers, power dividing components, and two RF windows. The RF characteristics of each component, such as the splitting ratio, phase shift, transmission, and reflection, were measured using a network analyzer. A taper adapter and matched load, which can be inserted into the active waveguide of the PAM mouth, were designed and fabricated for the phase shift and power coupling measurement. The maximum error and the standard deviation of measured phase shifts between adjacent active waveguides of the PAM were 6.5° and 2.28°, respectively. The design improvement of the mid-plane PAM launcher is suggested. Multiple round trips of the reflected field in a multijunction provides the advantage of lowering the reflection but, at the same time, it causes the deterioration of directivity and an increase of the electric field in the waveguide. Adding a hybrid splitter at the end of the multijunction structure reduces the reflection by redirecting the reflection to plasma as in multijunction, however, contrary to the multijunction, it does not switch the toroidal direction of phase progression and thus improves the antenna directivity. The directivity of the hybrid PAM increases by more than 10\% and the reflection decreases to 1/3–1/ 100 in comparison with the prototype PAM.},

Circular TE01 mode will be adopted for transmission lines longer than 50 m because it has extremely low loss in oversized waveguide, but mode converters from rectangular TE10 to circular TE01 mode are not easy to design. Mock-ups of two types of mode converters were developed. One is serpentine type, and the other is symmetric sidewall coupling type. The TE01 mode purities were demonstrated by measuring the transmission eﬃciencies between two identical mode converters at various angles between symmetric planes. A sidewall coupling mode converter with a reﬁned design, which showed better circular symmetry and higher transmission eﬃciency than serpentine type, is under fabrication for prototype. The prototype mode converter is calculated to have 99.5\% transmission eﬃciency, with 0.16\% diﬀraction loss and 0.35\% resistive loss, according to the simulation.},

	abstract = {Waves at a frequency close to the lower hybrid (LH) resonance are widely used in tokamaks for non-inductive current drive. Modelling of LH waves is usually carried out by combining a Ray-tracing (RT) code for computing the LH waves propagation to a solver of the Fokker–Planck (FP) equation which calculates an electron distribution function self-consistently with the waves absorption. The DELPHINE code has been developed along this approach with accurate treatment of the magnetic equilibrium and the fast electrons dynamics in momentum space. Using this code, the inﬂuence of the plasma current on the LH waves propagation and absorption is investigated in detail. High plasma current is found to broaden the absorbed LH spectrum towards high phase velocities, thus increasing the current drive efﬁciency of the waves. The shape of the current density proﬁle also has an impact on the propagation of the waves and the resulting power deposition. In discharges where the current proﬁle is dominated by LH current drive (LHCD), this dependence leads to the auto-regulation of the LHCD via the current density proﬁle. The RT/FP technique reproduces at least qualitatively some of the experimental trends, though inconsistencies still remain. Perspectives for improving the relevance of the modelling are discussed.},

The coupling characteristics agree fairly well with theory, and a power of up to 2 MW was obtained after a few days of conditioning. The dependence of the current drive efficiency »/CD ( = neIRFR/PLH) on the wave spectrum was studied by changing the phase difference between the adjacent main waveguides. It was found that high current drive efficiency is obtained by waves interacting with fast electrons as far into the plasma as the waves travel. A maximum current drive efficiency of 2.8 x 1019 A - W ' - m " 2 was achieved with this launcher at a plasma current of 1 MA. The efficiency of the multijunction launcher was higher by 40\% than that of the previous conventional launcher on JT-60.},

	abstract = {The discharge at a pillbox-type waveguide vacuum window for a Lower Hybrid Resonant Frequency (LHRF) launcher at 2 GHz is studied experimentally. A discharge is observed near the window at a pressure below lo-’ Pa. The discharge has little or no effect on the RF-transmission waveform; however, the temperature rise of the ceramic due to the discharge reaches about 100 times higher than that in a no discharge case. Moreover, the breakdown of gas in the waveguide is enhanced by the discharge. The discharge can be suppressed by sufficient RF conditioning and/or by coating the window with materials having a low secondary electron-emission ratio such as carbon or TiN. These results are accurately explained by the theory of single-surface multipactoring discharge induced by an electric field perpendicular to the ceramic and the space charge.},

	abstract = {The application of lower hybrid range of frequencies (LHRF) waves in H-mode plasmas on Alcator C-Mod can result in a signiﬁcant reduction in core particle inventory, with no signiﬁcant degradation of energy conﬁnement. This phenomenon has been observed in steady enhanced Dα (EDA) H-mode targets, which are sustained by ion cyclotron RF auxiliary heating, in which pedestal density nped is usually tied ﬁrmly to plasma current IP and shows a strong resilience to changes in the edge neutral source. Upon application of up to 1 MW LHRF power, nped is reduced by up to 30\%, while the temperature proﬁle increases simultaneously such that the pressure pedestal remains constant or is slightly increased. Steady EDA H-mode operation with no edge-localized modes can be maintained while edge collisionality is reduced by factors of reduction of 2–4. Elevation of scrape-off layer (SOL) density and electric currents accompany the application of LHRF (at levels as low as 400 kW) with a fast time response (∼10−2 s), while full density pedestal relaxation and core density reduction occur on longer time scales (∼10−1 s). A similarly prompt counter-IP change in the edge toroidal velocity is also observed in response to LHRF, followed on longer time scales by a counter-IP change in the central rotation. The range of time scales of the plasma response may indicate that the radial locations of LHRF interactions (i.e. SOL versus core), and power deposition mechanisms, are evolving in time. Understanding the responsible physical mechanisms and applying them to a broad range of discharges could provide a tool for improved H-mode density control.},

These antenna coupling codes often approximate the plasma to a surface impedance described by a 1D half inﬁnite models and antennas either with simpliﬁed 2D dimensions or from 3D CAD models conversion. Such approaches add an additional step of model approximation/conversion which is not convenient to rapidly assess impact of geometry changes on coupling performances. In this work, we assess the ability of using ANSYS HFSS to describe the usual range of experimental magnetized cold plasma inhomogeneous parameters facing LHRF antennas, away from resonances, in order to guide the RF designer during the design phase of an antenna. The coupling calculations of Lower Hybrid Resonance Frequency antennas are performed and successfully benchmarked with the fast coupling codes ALOHA on inhomogeneous cold magnetized plasmas. Good agreements are obtained when the boundary conditions in the full-wave modelling are properly handled. Practical advices and limitations are given in order to deﬁne correctly these boundary conditions and insure correct results.},

The window design rely on a symmetrical pill-box concept with a cylindrical beryllium oxide ceramic brazed on an actively water cooled copper skirt. The ceramic RF properties have been measured on a test sample to get realistic values for guiding the design. Low power measurements of the manufactured windows show return losses below −32 dB and insertion losses between −0.01 dB and −0.05 dB, with an optimum frequency shifted toward lower frequencies. High power tests conducted at NFRI show unexpected total power loss for both windows. The ceramic temperature during RF pulses has been found to reach unexpected high temperature, preventing these windows to be used under CW conditions. A post-mortem RF analysis of samples taken from one window shows that the dielectric properties of the ceramic were not the ones measured on the manufacturer sample, which partly explain the differences with the reference modelling.},

Lower Hybrid Current Drive (LHCD) is currently the most efficient method to generate a continuous additional off-axis toroidal plasma current as well as reduce the poloidal flux consumption during the plasma current ramp-up phase. The operation of the Tore Supra ITER-like LH launcher and 700kW CW klystrons have demonstrated the ability to couple LH power at ITER-like power densities with very low reflected power during long pulses. However, in order to achieve pure stationary LH sustained plasmas, some R\&D are needed to increase the reliability of all the systems and codes, from the RF sources to the plasma scenario prediction. The CEA/IRFM is addressing some of these issues by leading a R\&D program toward an ITER LH system and by the validation of an integrated LH modeling suite of codes. In 2011, the RF design of a mode converter has been validated at low power. A 500 kW/5 s RF window is currently under manufacturing and will be tested at high power in 2012 in collaboration with NFRI. All of this work aims to reduce the operational risks associated with the ITER steady-state operations.},

This approach is completed either by a full-wave computation of the antenna that takes into account its detailed geometry or by a mode-matching code dedicated to multijunctions modelling, which is convenient in preliminary design phases. Moreover, ALOHA can treat more realistic scrape-off layers in front of the antenna, by using a two-layer electron density proﬁle. The ALOHA code has been compared with experimental results from Tore Supra LH antennas of different geometries, as well as benchmarked against other LH coupling codes, with very good results.

We report on the first measurements of both the energy from 0 to 1 keV and the radial-poloidal distributions of the accelerated electrons using a retarding field analyzer. Two distinct electron populations are present : a cold, thermal population with temperatures between 10 and 30 eV, and a suprathermal component. Only partial attenuation of the electron flux was achieved at maximum applied voltage, indicating energies greater than 1 keV. Detailed 2D mapping of the hot spots was obtained by varying the safety factor stepwise during a single discharge. The radial width of the suprathermal electron beam at full power is rather large, at least about 5-6 cm, in contrast to Landau damping theory of the launched wave that predicts the radial width of the hot spots should not exceed a few millimetres [2]. The electron flux far from the grill is intermittent, with a typical burst rate of the order of 10 kHz.},

	abstract = {A new multijunction grill-type launcher has been tested on the Petula-B tokamak. In this new launcher, the RF power is divided by means of an E-plane junction, and the phase between each resultant wave is obtained by a suitable reduction in the height of the waveguides. Data obtained on Petula-B indicate that both the heating efficiency (4.5 eV X 1013 cm"3 -kW"1) and the parametric dependences of the reflection coefficient are very similar to those of a conventional grill. Therefore, such a multyunction grill may greatly simplify the construction of grills considered for use in future large-scale tokamaks.},

The LHCD efﬁciency is analysed from the fast electron bremsstrahlung (FEB) and electron cyclotron emission (ECE). The effect of plasma equilibrium and particle fuelling is documented. It is concluded that the fast decay of FEB with plasma density could be consistent with simple scaling of the current drive efﬁciency and FEB. Plasma edge measurements are presented looking for the effect on fast electron emission. In a speciﬁc case of particle fuelling, an anomalous decay of the hard x-ray and ECE signals suggests deleterious interaction of the wave with edge plasma.},

	abstract = {Multipactor, the well-known electron avalanche phenomena occurring in waveguides when the amplitude of the RF electric ﬁeld exceeds a threshold, is modelled for lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) antennas. The electric ﬁeld threshold departures signiﬁcantly from the expected linear scaling with the frequency when the width of the waveguide along the electric ﬁeld increases. For 5 GHz waveguides, the multipactor does not occur when this width exceeds 26 mm, in very good agreement with analytical formulation. Effect of static magnetic ﬁeld with typical values of tokamak environment is examined. It is found that the threshold is weakly reduced (−6\%) for the front face of the antenna featuring the rows of narrow waveguides. Strong reduction in the threshold is found where the wave frequency equals the electron cyclotron frequency (0.178 T at 5 GHz) but this condition will not be met on ITER. After baking at 240 ◦C, wide waveguides at the antenna input (29 mm on ITER) have a threshold of ∼7 kV cm−1, assuming a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld. However, preliminary results indicate higher threshold when the gradient of the magnetic ﬁeld along the waveguide is taken into account and no limitation, from this section, is expected for the ITER LHCD antenna.},

Although the power density of 25 MW m−2 has been exceeded in L-mode and almost obtained in ELMy H-mode (on 1/6th of the antenna), it is concluded that the RF conditioning performed on JET does not allow us to exceed an electric ﬁeld of ∼5.5 kV cm−1 which is generally not sufﬁcient under the rather weak coupling conditions of the JET H-mode. Modelling of an arc occurring in a waveguide indicates that rather small variations of the reﬂected wave (amplitude and phase) may occur, rendering arc detection based on RF measurements difﬁcult in some cases. The JET bolometry diagnostic with four chords viewing the antenna front is found to be an efﬁcient tool to detect an arc. In L-mode plasmas, a very good correlation between the amplitude of the bolometry signals and the iron spectroscopic lines is found. In H-mode the arc detection is clearly more difﬁcult with enhanced radiation during the ELM but is still possible when the bolometry signals are properly processed.},

Specific components, such as the mode converter and hyperguide have now been successfully tested at high power and long pulse duration (up to lo00 s on test bed). The 50 MW required to cover the envisioned scenarios, can be coupled by two launchers located in two ports of the machine.

	abstract = {Fast electrons generated in front of lower hybrid (LH) grills can cause damage to tokamak divertor and ﬁrst wall components. It is therefore of interest to identify possible edge electron acceleration mechanisms and suggest measures to limit these. One possible acceleration process described here depends on mode overlap in the antenna electric ﬁeld spectrum and on the presence of high-n modes, resonant with the ambient (∼25 eV) edge electrons. These electrons then diffuse throughout the globally stochastic region of n -space whose upper bound is given by the last overlapping mode. It is shown that the described acceleration is seriously aggravated by the presence of higher order waveguide modes generated at sharp waveguide–plasma transitions and that rounding-off the waveguide septa can considerably reduce the ﬁelds and electron acceleration associated with these higher order modes. Additional antenna ﬁeld non-uniformities arising from a grill modular structure and random ﬁelds generated at the plasma edge through parametric decay and scattering of the LH slow wave from plasma density ﬂuctuations can further enhance the edge electron energy.},

	abstract = {A phase-controlled lower hybrid wave (LHW) multi-junction (MJ) coupler (3(rows)×4(columns)×4 (subwaveguides)) has been developed in the HT-7 tokamak. Simulations show that it is more eﬀective for driving plasma current than an ordinary phase-controlled LHW antenna (3(rows)× 12(columns)) (traditional coupler). The plasma–wave coupling experiments show that the reﬂection coeﬃcient (RC) is below 10\%, implying that the MJ grill can launch the wave into the plasma eﬀectively. The eﬀect of power spectrum launched by the MJ coupler on RC indicates that an optimal condition is requisite for a better coupling in the lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) experiments. Studies indicate that the drive eﬃciency of the MJ antenna is higher than that of the traditional one, which is mainly ascribed to the discrepancy in impurity concentration, plasma temperature, and spectrum directivity. An improved conﬁnement with an electron internal transport barrier is obtained by LHCD. The analysis shows that the modiﬁed negative (low) magnetic shear and the change of radial electric ﬁeld proﬁle due to LHCD are possible factors responsible for the eITB formation.},

A combination of ray-tracing and Fokker–Planck calculations are presented for various plasma scenarios, wave frequency and polarization. The dependence of the driven current and the location of power deposition upon the coupled wave spectrum is systematically determined, in order to set objectives for the antenna design. The respective effects of ﬁnite-power levels, magnetic trapping, and detailed antenna spectra are accounted for and quantitatively estimated. The sensitivity of LHCD to density and temperature proﬁles is calculated. From the simulation results, an optimum value for the parallel index of refraction is proposed as a compromise between efﬁciency and robustness with respect to those proﬁle variations. The corresponding current drive efﬁciency is found to be similar for the two frequencies generally considered for ITER, f = 3.7 GHz and f = 5.0 GHz.},

The chaotic diffusion of the “time-averaged” parallel wave number at higher values (with respect to that launched by the antenna at the plasma edge) has been evaluated, in order to ﬁnd an explanation of the ﬁlling of the spectral gap (Fisch, 1987) by “Hamiltonian chaos” in the Lower Hybrid Current Drive (LHCD) experiments (Fisch, 1978). The present work shows that the increase of the parallel wave number n due to toroidal effects, in the case of the typical plasma parameters of the Frascati Tokamak Upgrade (FTU) experiment, is insufﬁcient to explain the ﬁlling of the spectral gap, and the consequent current drive and another mechanism must come into play to justify the wave absorption by Landau damping. Analytical calculations have been supplemented by a numerical algorithm based on the symplectic integration of the ray equations implemented in a ray tracing code, in order to preserve exactly the symplectic character of a Hamiltonian ﬂow.},

The lower hybrid current drive could in principle be used as an efﬁcient tool. However, previous understanding considered the electron temperature envisaged in a reactor at the plasma periphery too large to allow penetration of the coupled radio frequency (RF) power due to strong Landau damping. In this work, we present new numerical results based on quasilinear theory, showing that the injection of power spectra with different n// widths of the main lobe produce an RF-driven current density proﬁle spanning most of the outer radial half of the plasma (n// is the refractive index in a parallel direction to the conﬁnement magnetic ﬁeld). Plasma kinetic proﬁles envisaged for the DEMO reactor are used as references. We demonstrate the robustness of the modeling results concerning the key role of the spectral width in determining the lower hybrid-driven current density proﬁle. Scans of plasma parameters are extensively carried out with the aim of excluding the possibility that any artefact of the utilised numerical modeling would produce any novelty. We neglect here the parasitic effect of spectral broadening produced by linear scattering due to plasma density ﬂuctuations, which mainly occurs for low magnetic ﬁeld devices. This effect will be analyzed in other work that completes the report on the present breakthrough.},

A major objective of research on current drive in the longer term is to find a way of driving a tokamak reactor in a steady state, while keeping the level of power which has to be recirculated back into the reactor within reasonable bounds.

	abstract = {A new concept -the reflector waveguide array -is proposed to improve and simplify the design of continuous wave lower hybrid (LH) launchers for steady state reactor applications. Mechanical robustness of the antenna and efficient heat removal are provided by a thick wall waveguide structure that can accommodate a large number of cooling ducts. The plasma facing mouthpiece could be made of the same material as the reactor first wall and could be easily replaceable through remote handling. In order to compensate for the increased horizontal distance between adjacent waveguides, the front ends of the thick septa are grooved to form short (”X/4) passive waveguides that act as reflectors between the radiofrequency powered waveguides (drivers). Then, for an adequate phasing between the active waveguides, the total electric field at the reflector waveguide apertures varies coherently with the one in the drivers to launch a highly directional slow wave. It is shown that the coupling properties of such an array and the directivity of the radiated power spectrum are similar to those of present day launchers. Their dependences upon the depth of the reflector waveguides, and the electron density and its gradient are investigated. The effect of changing the phase between the drivers is also studied. The proposed reflector LH antenna would provide enough flexibility to vary the N11 spectrum for plasma control purposes in a steady state fusion reactor.},

The designed LH system relies on a transmitter made of 24 5 GHz 1 MW klystrons linked to one antenna based on the passive active multijunction (PAM) concept, via a 60 m long oversized circular transmission line. Through a common European effort including several associations (CEA, ENEA, UKAEA, IST, TEKES and IPP-CZ) many outstanding problems have been solved: coupling has been achieved on JET in a physics scenario similar to ITER, a PAM has been tested with success on the FTU plasma. The reliability of LH for long pulse operation has been ascertained on Tore Supra. In order to routinely realise long pulse operation (1000 s), the Tore Supra LH system is being refurbished within the CIMES project framework where the transmitter is to be equipped with 16 klystrons 700 kW 1000 s at a frequency of 3.7 GHz. A new LH launcher based upon the PAM concept has been studied, designed and is actually under realisation.},

	abstract = {Lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) has been demonstrated to be an important actuator for controlling the current proﬁles of advanced tokamak plasmas, either in fully non-inductive or in hybrid regimes. To continue such scenario development in JET, and most notably towards extrapolations for ITER, an upgrade of its LH launcher is required to deliver more power ({\textgreater}5 MW) and to deal with a broad array of density situations at the plasma edge more consistently. These may range from steep gradients to ELM activity; extend from as low as the cut-off density nec to large and fast density variations and give rise to strong and rapid reﬂections of RF power. The passive active multijunction (PAM), advocated as the LH launcher concept for ITER, is claimed to be more resilient to such conditions, run with increased efﬁciency near nec and even with a small vacuum gap, being also specially appropriate for long pulse operation—all conditions hampering traditional designs. In addition, some of this leverage has been conﬁrmed experimentally at the ITER-relevant FTU with the ﬁrst PAM ever deployed, and more recently with Tore Supra’s PAM. The JET version addressed in this study, with the latter focusing on the physics that drives and supports the adopted technical solutions, allows the injection of up to 5.2 MW at 3.7 GHz and N{\textbar}{\textbar}peak = 1.9. With directivities better than 70\%, reﬂection coefﬁcients below 2\% even for ∼nec and power densities comparable to those foreseen for ITER at 5 GHz, it would validate this concept in ITER-relevant scenarios.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the results of a benchmark exercise in which the predictions of several simulation models for lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) were compared using parameters typical of the steady state operating scenario in the ITER device (the so-called Scenario 4). The most complete LHCD simulation models that were used combined 2D velocity space Fokker Planck solvers with toroidal ray tracing packages. These models also predicted the highest LHCD efficiencies with 2.0 – 2.6 MA of driven current for 30 MW of coupled LHRF power. Codes that solved the Fokker Planck equation using a Green’s function approach and then computed the driven LH current using a wave induced RF flux based on 1D parallel velocity damping along ray trajectories were found to predict LH currents 35-40\% lower than the 2D Fokker Planck models. This discrepancy is understood in terms of the approximate nature of the 1D wave induced flux that fails to properly capture 2D velocity space effects that occur in LHCD owing to the significant distortion of the electron distribution function. We also used an orbit-following Monte Carlo code to study the possible parasitic damping of LH waves on fusion generated alpha particles. The effect of magnetic field ripple and fast ion anomalous transport on the alpha population was considered. It was found that for a large anomalous diffusion coefficient (1m2/s), the absorption on fusion alphas can be as high as 7.7\% using a LHRF source frequency of 3.7 GHz. This result gives some confidence in the source frequency choice of 5.0 GHz in order to minimize the possibility of this parasitic interaction.},

Facing the plasma directly, the surface of the first mirrors could be sputtered by energetic particles or deposited with contaminants eroded from the first wall (tungsten and beryllium), which would result in the degradation of the reflectivity. The impurity deposits emphasize the necessity of the first mirror in situ cleaning for ITER. The mock-up first mirror system for ITER edge Thomson scattering diagnostics has been cleaned in EAST for the first time in a tokamak using radio frequency capacitively coupled plasma. The cleaning properties, namely the removal of contaminants and homogeneity of cleaning were investigated with molybdenum mirror insets (25 mm diameter) located at five positions over the mock-up plate (center to edge) on which 10 nm of aluminum oxide, used as beryllium proxy, were deposited. The cleaning efficiency was evaluated using energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, reflectivity measurements and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Using argon or neon plasma without magnetic field in the laboratory and with a 1.7 T magnetic field in the EAST tokamak, the aluminum oxide films were homogeneously removed. The full recovery of the mirrors’ reflectivity was attained after cleaning in EAST with the magnetic field, and the cleaning efficiency was about 40 times higher than that without the magnetic field. All these results are promising for the plasma cleaning baseline scenario of ITER.},

	abstract = {Almost all optical diagnostic systems in ITER will require the implementation of mirror recovery and protection systems. Plasma cleaning is considered to be the most promising technique for the removal of metal deposits from optical surfaces. The engineering and physical aspects of RF discharge application for continuous or periodic plasma treatment are discussed with a focus on implementation under ITER conditions. The ion flux parameters obtained in capacitively coupled (CC) RF discharge were measured in the mock-up of a plasma cleaning system. The uniformity of sputtering in CC RF discharge with and without a magnetic field was studied experimentally for the cylindrical discharge reactor geometry and compared with numerical simulations. The sharp increase in the sputtering rate resulting from the non-uniform radial distribution of the ion flux was observed near the electrode edges. The longitudinal magnetic field improves sputtering uniformity. It was demonstrated that Al/Al2O3 deposits can be removed in the Ne and D2 plasma of CC RF discharge but longterm exposition results in the degradation of the polycrystalline molybdenum mirror surface. The efficiency of Al sputtering in the atmosphere containing O2 and N2 fractions was studied in the D2/O2 and D2/N2 plasma of glow discharge. The addition of 2\% of oxygen or nitrogen increases the sputtering yield by 3–4 times as compared with that in a nominally pure D2 discharge. The impact of metal deposits on the performance of diagnostic mirrors is discussed. It was shown that an ultrathin metallic film with a thickness as low as a few nm may cause a significant degradation of diagnostic mirrors with a transparent coating.},

Their lifetimes should be extremely limited due to their proximity to burning plasma, greatly inﬂuencing the safe operation of corresponding diagnostics. Repetitive cleaning is expected to provide a solution to the frequent replacement of contaminated FMs, thus prolonging their lifetimes. Three repetitive cleaning cycles using radio frequency plasma were applied to stainless steel (SS) FM samples, to evaluate the change of the mirrors’ optical properties and morphology during each cycle. Amorphous carbon ﬁlms were deposited on mirror surfaces under identical conditions in three cycles. In three cycles with identical cleaning parameters, the total reﬂectivity was restored at up to 95\%. Nevertheless, with successive cleaning cycles, the FM surfaces gradually appeared to roughen due to damage to the grain boundaries. Correspondingly, the diffuse reﬂectivity increased from a few percent to 20\% and 27\% after the second and third cycles. After optimizing the cleaning parameters of the second and third cycles, the roughness showed a signiﬁcant decrease, and simultaneously the increase of diffuse reﬂectivity was remarkably improved.},

In addition, dense oxide ﬁlms are produced for comparisons with porous ﬁlms. The composition, morphology and crystal structure of several ﬁlms were characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction and secondary ion mass spectrometry. The cleaning of the deposits and the restoration of the mirrors’ optical properties are possible either with a Kaufman source or radio frequency directly applied to the mirror (or radio frequency plasma generated directly around the mirror surface).

Using radio frequency (13.56 MHz) argon plasma, the removal of a 260 nm mixed aluminium/aluminium oxide ﬁlm deposited by magnetron sputtering on a mirror (98 mm diameter) was demonstrated. 50 nm of pure aluminium oxide were removed from test mirrors (25 mm diameter) in a magnetic ﬁeld of 0.35 T for various angles between the ﬁeld lines and the mirrors surfaces.

	abstract = {Metallic mirrors exposed in TCV tokamak were cleaned by plasma in laboratory. A gold (Au) mirror was deposited with 185–285 nm of amorphous carbon (aC:D) ﬁlm coming from the carbon tiles of TCV. Another molybdenum (Mo) mirror had a thicker deposit due to a different location within the tokamak. The thickness measurements were carried out using ellipsometry and the reﬂectivity measurements performed by spectrophotometry revealed a decrease of the specular reﬂectivity in the entire range (250–2500 nm) for the Mo mirror and speciﬁcally in the visible spectrum for the Au. Comparison of the simulated reﬂectivity using a refractive index of 1.5 and a Cauchy model for the aC:D gives good conﬁdence on the estimated ﬁlm thickness. Plasma cleaning using radio frequency directly applied to a metallic plate where the mirrors were ﬁxed demonstrated the ability to remove the carbon deposits. A mixture of 50\% hydrogen and 50\% helium was used with a −200 V self-bias. Due to the low sputtering yield of He and the low chemical erosion of hydrogen leading to volatile molecules, 20 h of cleaning were needed for Au mirror and more than 60 h for Mo mirror. Recovery of the reﬂectivity was not complete for the Au mirror most likely due to damage of the surface during tokamak exposure (breakdown phenomena).},

	abstract = {Glow discharge cleaning (GDC) is a common technique for the conditioning of tokamak vessel walls in order to improve plasma performance and will be one of the primary conditioning techniques in ITER. The GDC discharge is a dc low-temperature plasma discharge, operated in the absence of the toroidal magnetic field, between one or more anodes inserted into the vessel, and the entire vessel wall serving as a cathode. This paper presents a self-consistent twodimensional model of the GDC discharge with the aim of improving fundamental understanding and predicting the wall ion current density distribution in ITER. The model combines a standard fluid model of the quasineutral plasma bulk with non-standard fluid equations for the fast electrons accelerated by the cathode sheath, based on transport coefficients and rate coefficients deduced from a Monte Carlo simulation. Examples of model results are shown in order to illustrate the general principles of the GDC discharge and the influence of the model input parameters. An important insight gained from this work is that the GDC discharge operates in a so-called hollow-cathode regime: the plasma is sustained mainly by ionization by secondary electrons emitted from the cathode, accelerated ballistically through a thin cathode sheath, penetrating the plasma as a fast electron beam, and trapped by the cathode fall surrounding the plasma on all sides. The electric field distribution inside the plasma, which determines the ion flux distribution on the vessel walls, is controlled by low-energy plasma bulk electrons. The relatively small surface area of the anode leads to the formation of an anode glow affecting the plasma uniformity. Comparisons with experimental data and predictions for ITER are presented in a companion paper.},

From the results of a high-power examination of rf windows with several kinds of alumina ceramic, it was found that alumina with a crystallized grain boundary and without any voids between the boundaries, thus having a low loss tangent value, is not liable for F centers, even under multipactoring. Flashover in a tree-like pattern of alumina luminescence occasionally takes place on a TiN-coated surface where multipactoring is suppressed.

	abstract = {Electron multipacting can cause breakdown in high RF power components like couplers and windows. The phenomenon starts if certain resonant conditions for electron trajectories are fulﬁlled and if the impacted surface has a secondary electron yield larger than one. A general cure against multipacting is to avoid the resonant conditions by a proper choice of the geometry. In many cases, however, it might not be possible to change the RF geometry suﬃciently. Therefore, other methods are required to suppress multipacting, like grooving the surfaces or static electric and magnetic perturbations. In this paper, we investigate by numerical simulations the eﬀect of a biasing DC voltage to multipacting in two special ceramic window geometries. Those are the DESY and FNAL cylindrical symmetric cold window designs of the TESLA input power coupler. We show that in both window designs multipacting can be avoided by choosing an appropriate biasing voltage. \# 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a review of the electrical radio frequency measurement techniques used in glow discharge optical emission spectrometry (GD-OES). In the introduction we show that for accurate quantitative chemical measurements reproducible electrical measurements are necessary. In the main part we introduce the techniques to generate the radio frequency (RF) and to measure voltage, current and power of the RF discharges. The required bandwidth of a RF current probe is estimated. Directional couplers used for the power measurement are introduced and their properties and limits are discussed. An overview of the different numerical and electronic evaluation methods for the voltage, current and power signals is given. New electrical measurements at the start up of a RF discharge and of a microsecond pulsed RF discharge show the benefit of the glow discharge source with integrated voltage and current probes. We present the use of the evaluated parameters to describe the dependence of the sputtering rate and the optical emission on RF discharge voltage and current using the model of Boumans and Bengtson. We also discuss the techniques to measure thick insulating materials and thin insulating layers with RF-GD-OES. Especially the evaluation of discharge voltage and current is presented in detail.},

The SEE coefﬁcients of TiN-coated alumina ceramics were lower than those of uncoated ones and nearly unity for TiN thickness of more than 1 nm, even with incident energy of 1 keV. To emulate multipactor-induced surface heating, the SEE coefﬁcients were also measured at high temperature. The results showed a decrease in the SEE coefﬁcients with temperature for TiN thickness of more than 0.5 nm. TiN coating on an rf window should be as thin as possible, and 0.5–1 nm may be the optimum thickness for suppressing multipactor.},

The code allows one to simulate all stages of the multipactor discharge, from the onset of the electron avalanche to saturation. It is shown that the threshold for the excitation of a single-surface multipactor on a dielectric placed in a low-profile waveguide with absorbing walls increases as compared to that in the case of an unbounded dielectric surface due to escape of electrons onto the waveguide walls. It is found that, depending on the microwave field amplitude and the SEE characteristics of the waveguide walls, the multipactor may operate in two modes. In the first mode, which takes place at relatively low microwave amplitudes, a single-surface multipactor develops only on the dielectric, the surface of which acquires a positively potential with respect to the waveguide walls. In the second mode, which occurs at sufficiently high microwave intensities, a single-surface multipactor on the dielectric and a two-surface multipactor between the waveguide walls operate simultaneously. In this case, both the dielectric surface and the interwall space acquire a negative potential. It is shown that electron scattering from the dielectric surface and waveguide walls results in the appearance of high-energy tails in the electron distribution function.},

Occasional flashovers were observed on TiN-coated surfaces, though the multipactor effect is suppressed by the coating.

This flashover threshold depends on the dielectric materials; a sapphire with F-center defects shows a lower threshold. For further investigations of the flashover mechanism under an rf field, in situ measurements of the charges built up on the surface both before and after flashover and high-speed photography observations of the flashover avalanches have been made. The results indicate an electron accumulation; its relaxation leaves positive charges on the surface. The relaxation time is found to be {\textless} 40 ns. The velocity of the avalanche growth under the rf field is estimated to be {\textgreater} l o 6 m/s.},

Then, we have investigated the multipactor phenomena in coaxial lines considering three kinds of RF signals: traveling, standing, and mixed waves. From this paper, we conclude that different breakdown thresholds are obtained for any of the considered RF excitations under high values of frequency × gap product. This effect is attributed to the existence of regions with zero (or very low levels) electric ﬁeld amplitude in the propagation direction, where electrons are absorbed before the discharge occurs.},

	abstract = {Multipactor is a low power, electron multiplication based resonance breakdown phenomenon in vacuum often observed in radio frequency (RF) and microwave systems. A multipactor discharge is often undesirable as it can create a reactive component that detunes the resonant cavities, generates noise in communication system and induces gas desorption from the conductor surfaces. Multipactor breakdown on dielectric surface is also a major concern for failure of vacuum window in klystrons, cyclotrons and accelerators. Despite of these, the multipactor discharge is not absolutely undesirable. Its usefulness is being explored in electron gun technology, plasma display technology, ICRH antenna conditioning etc. Since multipactor is a pure electron resonance phenomenon, it can happen without any gas being present in the system. Nevertheless, the massive electron bombardment on conductor surfaces removes substantial amount of adsorbed gas species and increases the neutral pressure. In the presence of neutrals these resonant electrons ionize the gaseous atoms and forms the plasma known as multipactor plasma. Many of the high power RF components used in the vacuum transmission line interface sections of ICRH system are having restricted access to surface condition them especially the inner conductors of transmission line sections and dielectric material of vacuum window. By suitably choosing the operating frequency and a minimum pressure, it is possible to form a multipactor plasma in the above components to condition them. Such a conditioning technique is adopted for conditioning of vacuum window and vacuum transmission line of ICRH system. In this paper, an overview of multipactor plasma, a brief description of the test set up, testing conditions and conditioning results are presented.},

The windows were coated with 1.5 nm-thick TiN "lms in order to suppress multipactor, and have been used under X-ray irradiation.

XRD analysis was performed to control the film composition. The obtained measurements point out how the Nitrogen vacancy on the film can be controlled very well acting on the N2 flow during the reacting sputtering process. As the coating thickness should be optimized so that the TiN effectively reduces the SEE coefficient but does not cause excessive heating due to ohmic loss, and before multipactor level breakdown and resistance measurements for different deposit thicknesses, a good control of film thickness is essential. In-situ deposit thickness measurements given by quartz crystal microbalance was compared to X-Ray reflectivity one. A very good agreement was found between those two methods pointing out an efficient thickness and deposition rate monitoring. Once those steeps accomplished, an optimisation of deposition rate was performed in stoichiometric gas flow rate and electrical conditions.},

We have since developed a model of breakdown and gradient limits that tries to explain, in a self-consistent way: arc triggering, plasma initiation, plasma evolution, surface damage and gra- dient limits. We use simple PIC codes for modeling plasmas, molecular dynamics for modeling surface breakdown, and surface damage, and mesoscale surface thermodynamics and finite element electrostatic codes for to evaluate surface properties. Since any given experiment seems to have more variables than data points, we have tried to consider a wide variety of arcing (rf structures, e beam welding, laser ablation, etc.) to help constrain the problem, and concentrate on common mechanisms. While the mechanisms can be comparatively simple, modeling can be challenging.},

This model assumes that arcs develop as a result of mechanical failure of the surface due to Coulomb explosions, followed by ionization of fragments by field emission and the development of a small, dense plasma that interacts with the surface primarily through self sputtering and terminates as a unipolar arc capable of producing breakdown sites with high enhancement factors. We have attempted to produce a self consistent picture of triggering, arc evolution and surface damage. We are modeling these mechanisms using Molecular Dynamics (mechanical failure, Coulomb explosions, self sputtering), Particle-In-Cell (PIC) codes (plasma evolution), mesoscale surface thermodynamics (surface evolution), and finite element electrostatic modeling (field enhancements).

This parallel magnetic ﬁeld imposes electron Larmor motion, which restricts the trajectories of electrons accelerated by the RF ﬁeld. In open geometries, magnetic conﬁnement reduces electron losses in the multipactor region and can reduce the breakdown threshold. In this paper, the effect of magnetic conﬁnement on multipactor breakdown threshold was measured experimentally using a stripline ﬁxture with an externally applied uniform magnetic ﬁeld. Multipactor threshold power was reduced from the unmagnetized case by as much as 3 dB at magnetic ﬁelds of about 0.5 kG. Multipactor gap aspect ratio has a signiﬁcant impact on the degree of threshold reduction.},

	abstract = {In order to evaluate the electrical insulating potential of aluminium nitride as a radio frequency (rf) heating device, neutral beam injectors, magnetic coils, etc. in fusion reactors environments, the current±voltage (I±V) characteristics and electrical conductivity of poly-crystalline aluminum nitride, doped with 1 wt\% Y2O3 (AlN±1 wt\% Y2O3) have been measured before and during irradiation with 1 MeV electrons at temperatures up to 723 K. The I±V characteristics of AlN without irradiation are non-linear, while those with irradiation exhibit hysteresis. Blocking eect without irradiation is considered, and it changes with fast electron irradiation. Inconsistency in the I±V characteristics of AlN between positive and negative polarity during irradiation is found, and it is thought to be due to the electron charge deposition onto the single surface of the specimen. No bulk and surface RIED are found up to 1X5 Â 10À5 dpa. If the alpha-particles produced by high neutrons are assumed to be negligible, then AlN can be used as an alternative candidate material for the coating on the blanket of fusion reactors, because of the absence of severe thermally stimulated conductivity (TSC) and bulk and surface degradation under fusion reactors environments.

The test starid uses a 3 MW magnetron coupled to an S-band traveling wave resonator. Various configurations of dielectric windows are investigated. In a standard pillbox geometiry with a pressure of less than 10.' torr, surface discharges on an alumina window and multipactor-like discharges starting at the waveguide edges occur simultaneously. To clarify physical mechanisms, window breakdown with purely tangential electrical microwave fields is investigated for special geometries. Other configurations, such as air filled two window setups, relevant for vacuum-air interfaces, can be investi,gated as well. Diagnostics include the measurement of incidentheflected power, measurement of local microwave fields, discharge luminosity, and x-ray emission. All quantities are recorded with 0 . 2 to 1 ns resolution. In addition, a framing camera with gating times of 5 ns is used. Based on the experimental results, methods to increase the power density which can be transmitted through windows, such as surface coatings and window profiles, will be investigated as well.},

Multipactor-induced breakdowns can be critical to microwave systems in space communication payloads or in experimental fusion devices.

Moreover, in both space and fusion applications, the RF devices can be subjected to DC magnetic ﬁelds. This magnetic ﬁeld may affect the electron emission properties. In order to improve understanding and predictability of the multipactor effect, the assessment of DC magnetic ﬁeld on the electron emission properties is required; an experimental setup has been developed to measure the Total Electron Emission Yield (TEEY) under DC magnetic ﬁeld.

	abstract = {The unirradiated tensile properties for several different heats and thermomechanical treatment conditions of precipitation strengthened Hycon 3HP™ CuNiBe (Cu–2\%Ni–0.35\%Be in wt.\%) have been measured over the temperature range of 20–500 °C for longitudinal and long transverse orientations. The room temperature electrical conductivity has also been measured for several heats, and the precipitate microstructure was characterized using transmission electron microscopy. The CuNiBe alloys exhibit very good combination of strength and conductivity at room temperature, with yield strengths of 630–725 MPa and electrical conductivities of 65–72\% International Annealed Copper Standard (IACS). The strength remained relatively high at all test temperatures, with yield strengths of 420–520 MPa at 500 °C. However, low levels of ductility ({\textless}5\% uniform elongation) were observed at test temperatures above 200–250 °C, due to ﬂow localization near grain boundaries (exacerbated by having only 10–20 grains across the gage thickness of the miniaturized sheet tensile specimens). Scanning electron microscopy observation of the fracture surfaces found a transition from ductile transgranular to ductile intergranular fracture with increasing test temperature. Fission neutron irradiation to a dose of \$0.7 displacements per atom (dpa) at temperatures between 100 and 240 °C produced a slight increase in strength and a signiﬁcant decrease in ductility. The measured tensile elongation after irradiation increased with increasing irradiation temperature, with a uniform elongation of \$3.3\% observed at 240 °C. The electrical conductivity decreased slightly following irradiation, due to the presence of defect clusters and Ni, Zn, Co transmutation products. Considering also previously published fracture toughness data, this indicates that CuNiBe alloys have irradiated tensile and electrical properties comparable or superior to CuCrZr and oxide dispersion strengthened copper at temperatures {\textless}250 °C, and may be an attractive candidate for certain lowtemperature fusion energy structural applications. Conversely, CuNiBe may not be preferred at intermediate temperatures of 250–500 °C due to the poor ductility and fracture toughness of CuNiBe alloys at temperatures P250 °C. The potential deformation mechanisms responsible for the transition from transgranular to intergranular fracture are discussed. The possible implications for other precipitation-hardened alloys such as nickel based superalloys are brieﬂy discussed.},

A sensitivity analysis with respect to the brass plastic behavior and to the thickness of coating layers is also performed. The finite element results are used for an asperity-based model, which includes elasto-plastic deformation of asperities and their mutual elastic interactions. This model enables us to simulate the real morphology of contact spots at the roughness scale using the experimentally measured surface topography. Finally, the Greenwood multi-spot model is used to estimate the electrical contact resistance. This three-level model yields results which are in good agreement with experimental measurements carried out in this study.},

The methods of calculation at low and high temperature are reviewed, and the results of these calculations are presented to compare the effect at different temperatures. It is found that vacancy scattering can significantly reduce the thermal conductivity over a wide temperature range; for example, a vacancy concentration of 0.01 per atom leads to a fractional change of about 90\% at 77 K versus 43\% at 400 K. This reduction has significance for the design and placement of radio frequency and microwave windows in fusion reactors.},

Neutron irradiation is assumed to have no eﬀect on umklapp scattering. A theoretical model is presented to quantify the relative phonon-scattering eﬀectiveness of the three dominant defect types produced by neutron irradiation: point defects, dislocation loops and voids. Several commercial ceramics have been irradiated with ﬁssion reactor fast neutrons at low temperatures to produce defects. Materials include silicon carbide, sapphire, polycrystalline alumina, aluminum nitride, silicon nitride, beryllium oxide, and a carbon ﬁber composite. The neutron dose corresponded to 0.001 and 0.01 displacements per atom (dpa) for a \$60 °C irradiation and 0.01 and 0.1 dpa for a \$300 °C irradiation. Substantial thermal conductivity degradation occurred in all of the materials except BeO following irradiation at 60 °C to a dose of only 0.001 dpa. The data are discussed in terms of the eﬀective increase in thermal resistance caused by the diﬀerent irradiation conditions. Evidence for signiﬁcant point defect mobility during irradiation at 60 and 300 °C was obtained for all of the ceramics. The thermal stability of the radiation defects was investigated by isochronal annealing up to 1050 °C.},

When there is a requirement for the transmission of large currents at high current densities copper is used for the current path. Under high mechanical stress copper tends to creep depending on the stress, duration and temperature. This means, that the contact force decreases with time and thus, the contact resistance increases. As soon as the contact force drops below a certain minimum level the connection looses its reliability especially at higher current values. This ageing process is determined by the creep of copper. The process is calculated using a finite element model. For the calculation it is necessary to experimentally determine the relevant creep parameters. Using a contact element as an example it is shown how large the deformation of the copper in the highly stressed regions is and how large the resulting loss in contact force is. The comparison between calculation and measurement is in good agreement.},

	abstract = {An apparatus for making two-dimensional photon images of tribomicroplasma in controlled gas pressures was constructed. Using the apparatus, the dimensions, patterns, and photon emission intensities of the tribomicroplasma were investigated under various reduced air pressures when sliding a diamond hemisphere pin on a sapphire disk. It was found that the shapes and patterns of the two-dimensional plane photon images of the tribomicroplasma vary as a function of the air pressure. Two components of the photon image have been distinguished: (1) a small circular image, the shape and the size of which do not depend on the gas pressure, and (2) a larger image in the shape of a ring with a horseshoe pattern with and without tailing. The size of the second component depends largely on the gas pressure. The ﬁrst component corresponds to photon emission due to frictional heating, while the second one is the image of the tribomicroplasma generated by the gas discharge. As the air pressure decreases, the image of the tribomicroplasma expands and some parts of the image disappear until the tribomicroplasma image disappears completely at an air pressure of about 10 Pa, leaving only the circular frictional contact image. These characteristics have been explained by a gas discharge theory.},

Predictions from the model are validated against experiments conducted for the purpose. The experiments are performed according to a Design of Experiments approach, and evaluated using statistical regression. Three substrates (copper, brass, and aluminum) and three coatings (silver, nickel and tin) are considered with a variety of coating thicknesses and substrate roughnesses. The contact load is also varied. The experimental measurements show that the best choice of a coating for contact resistance mitigation depends on the substrate material and roughness, and cannot be prescribed in general. A regression equation developed for the experimental results offers a useful tool for the design of coated contacts. The measured results agree well with predicted values from the numerical model, especially in cases of a rough substrate or hard coating.},

          , 
            Increasing research effort has been made aiming at developing electromagnetic (EM) wave absorbing materials with high absorption performance. An ideal EM absorber should be relatively light-weight, thermally stable, capable of absorbing wide EM frequency, and cost effective. As a dielectric material, silicon carbide (SiC) has great potential with relatively low density, good thermal and chemical resistance, and it can function at high temperatures or under harsh working environments. This review summarizes the research progress in the design and characterization of SiC and SiC based composites as EM absorption materials. Pristine SiC with various morphological, phase, and structural features can be tailored to achieve better absorption performance. Moreover, SiC based materials can either be modified using dielectric or magnetic materials, or be designed with variation in geometry, composition, and mass fraction of the filler composition for further improvement in EM absorption. This review intends to inspire new concepts and approaches for designing excellent EM absorbing materials.},

	abstract = {The study presents the high-dose behavior of dielectric mirrors specifically engineered for radiation tolerance. Alternating layers of Al2O3/SiO2 and HfO2/ SiO2 were grown on sapphire substrates and exposed to neutron doses of 1 and 4 displacements per atom (dpa) at 458 + 10 K in the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR). In comparison to previously reported results, these higher doses of 1 and 4 dpa result in a drastic drop in optical reflectance, caused by a failure of the multilayer coating. HfO2/SiO2 mirrors failed completely when exposed to 1 dpa, whereas the reflectance of Al2O3/SiO2 mirrors reduced to 44\%, eventually failing at 4 dpa. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation of the Al2O3/SiO2 specimens showed SiO2 layer defects, which increase in size with irradiation dose. The typical size of each defect was \&8 nm in 1-dpa specimens and \&42 nm in 4-dpa specimens. Buckling-type delamination of the interface between the substrate and first layer was typically observed in both 1- and 4-dpa HfO2/SiO2 specimens. Composition changes across the layers were measured in high-resolution-scanning–TEM mode using energy dispersive spectroscopy. A significant interdiffusion between the film layers was observed in the Al2O3/SiO2 mirror, although it was less evident in the HfO2/SiO2 system. The ultimate goal of this work is to provide insight into the radiation-induced failure mechanisms of these mirrors.},

It is shown that, in some materials and some neutron spectra, transmutation can significantly affect or even dominate a given property change process. When the process under study is also sensitive to displacement rate, and especially if it involves radiationinduced segregation and precipitation, it becomes much more difficult to separate the transmutation and displacement rate dependencies. This complicates the application of data derived from "surrogate" spectra to predictions in other flux-spectra environments. It is also shown in this paper that one must be sensitive to the impact of previously-ignored "small" variations in neutron spectra within a given reactor.

The materials considered are alumina, aluminium nitride, beryllia, fused quartz, sialon, and silicon nitride. The properties considered are density, Young’s, bulk, and shear moduli, Poisson’s ratio, tensile, ﬂexural and compressive strength, thermal conductivity, speciﬁc heat capacity, and thermal expansion coefﬁcient. The data set, previously reported by de Faoite et al. (J Mater Sci 47(10):4211, 2012), was compiled to facilitate the materials selection and design of a ceramic component for the Variable Speciﬁc-Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASIMRÒ). Temperature-dependent material property data are required for accurate thermo-structural modelling of such ceramic components which operate over a wide temperature range. The goal of this paper is to calculate a set of regression coefﬁcients to reduce this data set to a tractable format for use in the materials selection and design of such components. Regression analysis could not be performed for all material properties for all of these materials, due to a lack of data in the literature, and these gaps in the available data are highlighted.},

For these applications, Rh coated CuCrZr components subject to long time of thermal ageing due to pre-treatment or normal operation condition. In this paper, both ﬁnite element method (FEM) and experimental method were applied to investigate the eﬀects of thermal ageing on mechanical performance of Rh coating after 250 °C, 500 h baking in vacuum. Based on FEM analysis, thermal stresses which concentrate at Rh coating interface is the main source of cracking, and such stresses can be minimized eﬃciently by introducing a 0.5 μm Au interlayer into the coating layer structure. According to thermal ageing experiments, through-thickness cracking in the Rh coating due to thermal stress releasing and voids generated at the Rh bonding interface caused by Kirkendall eﬀect were the main micro-structure changes in the coating system. The solid-solution hardening caused by signiﬁcant Cu diﬀusion into Rh is the dominant factor that aﬀected the Rh coating's hardness. The existing of large amount of cracks in the Rh coating and voids at the Rh coating interface deteriorated the adhesion performance of Rh on CuCrZr substrate by 30\%.},

	abstract = {Radio-frequency (RF) contacts—which are an example of electrical contacts—are commonly employed on accelerators and nuclear fusion experimental devices. RF contacts with a current load of 2 kA for steady-state operation were designed for application to the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) device. In contrast to the typical working conditions of general commercial electrical contacts, those of RF contacts employed on fusion devices include high vacuum, high temperature, and neutron radiation. CuCrZr is currently of interest as a base material for the manufacture of louvers of RF contacts, which has excellent thermal and electrical properties and has low creep rate at 250 °C. In this study, a hard Au coating (Au-Ni) was electroplated on CuCrZr samples and the samples were then subjected to thermal aging treatment at 250 °C for 500 h in order to simulate the vacuum-commissioning process of the ITER. The eﬀects of thermal aging on the hardness, elastic modulus, crystallite size, and compositions of the coating were investigated via microstructural and mechanical characterizations of the coating material. Metal atom migration in diﬀerent coating layers during thermal aging was characterized and evaluated via scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy observations of the cross-sectional surfaces, and the obtained results could be used to directly select the coating thickness for the ﬁnal RF contact component. The contact resistance—an important parameter of the RF contact—was measured in a dedicated testbed built to simulate fusion reactor conditions between CuCrZr pins and stainless steel plates coated with Au-Ni and Rh, respectively.},

This paper reports on a new customengineered, electroplated, nano-crystalline silver alloy (NCSA) material stack that differentiates itself from both traditional hard gold and other silver technologies by offering improved wear durability up to and beyond 104 mating cycles, as well as improved corrosion protection for immersion environmental exposures. Voltage-biased immersion tests involving common liquids such as perspiration and saline solutions as well as high cycling wear beyond 104 mating cycles have been conducted on a gold-on-nickel stack as well as two embodiments of the new NCSA final finish stack: 1) with the NCSA plated onto a nano-crystalline nickel-tungsten alloy (NCNA) as a barrier layer and 2) with the NCSA plated directly on the substrate with no nickel-based barrier layer. Both embodiments of the NCSA stack exhibited at least equivalent performance, and in some cases outperformed a standard gold-on-nickel stack in both wear durability and biased corrosion resistance.},

	abstract = {The calculation of the contact resistance between two rough electrodes is a difficult task, since the contact interface comprises many spots corresponding to more or less conducting paths for the electrons. The present paper starts with an analytical formula derived by J. A. Greenwood to find the electrical resistance of a cluster of perfect circular microcontacts. It is first shown that Greenwood’s formula can be used to derive known and new formulas for the constriction resistance of single spots of various shapes. Then we consider the case where the microcontacts are not perfect, and characterize each microcontact by a film resistance. To generalize Greenwood’s formula, we use an intermediate expression derived by this author, and substitute for the constriction resistance term of each spot, a term comprising the constriction resistance and the film resistance. We then test the formulas proposed in the paper. In all situations the electrical contact area is modeled by means of a set of square spots. At first, we consider experimental results concerning long rectangular spots. Then, we consider numerical results concerning square ring-shaped spots. And lastly, we consider the case where two large electrodes communicate through two concentric thin flat rings of variable conductivity. The contact resistance is then calculated using Greenwood’s generalized formula and by means of the finite-element method. All tests are passed satisfactorily.},

The fretting tests are conducted using a traditional bench, and a new structure made of cross cylinders is adapted for transmitting RF signal in the frequency range [10 MHz-10 GHz]. The structure is also designed to inject simultaneously DC current and RF signal. The corresponding electrical contact resistances are continuously measured during the test. DC and RF resistance evaluate qualitatively in the same way but with different magnitudes. RF resistance has a high value, which is due to the skin effect in high frequency. It is important to perform simultaneous DC and RF measurements because results may be very dispersive for each test and could prevent us from comparing them.},

These models demonstrate how recent trends in open source simulation technology use embedded equations as integral elements in component and physical process models.

@phdthesis{liptac_lower_2006,
	title = {Lower {Hybrid} {Modeling} and {Experiments} on {Alcator} {C}-{Mod}},
	abstract = {A highly ﬂexible phase control system was developed in order to dynamically adjust the parallel wave number spectrum of driven LH waves on Alcator C-Mod. Wave coupling between the antenna and the plasma was studied using this system. A coupling code was modiﬁed to allow arbitrary phase and amplitude in each waveguide, which was required for agreement between the theory and experiment. Remarkable agreement was achieved when a small vacuum gap of 0.6 to 1.4 mm was included in the model, similar to results obtained on ASDEX. The location of the fast electron population is critical in diagnosing the performance of the lower hybrid system and can be inferred by measuring nonthermal bremsstrahlung emission. A state-of-the-art diagnostic for hard x-ray (HXR) emission was designed and used to make measurements of fast electrons bremsstrahlung during LHCD experiments on C-Mod. The HXR diagnostic consists of an array of 32 CdZnTe detectors to image energies in the 20-200 keV range. Detectors and pulse processing electronics were integrated into a compact and modular package. The system also makes use of fast digitization and software signal processing techniques allowing a maximum counting rate of 1 MHz. HXR experimental results indicate a spatially broad and centered fast electron population. HXR proﬁles predicted by a synthetic diagnostic in the Fokker-Planck code CQL3D are narrower than the observed proﬁles, suggesting the importance of spatial diﬀusion of fast electrons in the experiment. Lower hybrid experiments on C-Mod represent the ﬁrst results obtained with density, magnetic ﬁeld, plasma shape, and source frequency all near conditions expected on ITER. In initial experiments, about 400 kW of LH power was coupled for 400 ms into low density L-mode discharges. Clear evidence of current drive was seen as the loop voltage decreased by about 50\%. Studies were performed by varying the phase, density, and magnetic ﬁeld as well as changing the direction that the waves were launched. Analysis using CQL3D indicates that a current drive eﬃciency of 0.15 (1020 m−2A/W ) was obtained by driving 167 kA of LH current with 410 kW at a line-average density of 5.5×1019 m−3, without an electric ﬁeld. This eﬃciency exceeds what was observed on Alcator C, but is within the range observed on FTU for similar densities. Including the residual electric ﬁeld increased the LH driven current to 308 kA, corresponding to an increased eﬀective eﬃciency of 0.28. In addition to experiments, extensive modeling of current proﬁle control through phase variation was studied, including compound spectra, using CQL3D. It was found that over 200 kA of oﬀ-axis LH current can be generated in a variety of proﬁle shapes in an H-mode target plasma. Finally, time dependent modeling of an integrated scenario was performed using the transport code TRANSP to explore what performance can be ultimately achieved on C-Mod. Results indicate that fully non-inductive, quasi-steady-state plasmas are possible with bootstrap fractions as high as 75\%.},

The approach taken is to approximate the discontinuity as a string of closely spaced planar discontinuities. At each planar discontinuity, the transmission and reflection properties of the junction are computed by the mode-matching technique - a method which represents the fields on either side of the junction as a sum of known basis functions, and determines the weighting coefficients by matching the fields across an aperture. The junctions are then cascaded to determine the overall scattering characteristics. Computer code is presented that implements the algorithms, and results are closely correlated to measurements and other analysis methods.},

This thesis explores issues related to breakdown in the Transcom TC2571 PHEMT, and the eﬀects this has on the Draper Laboratory 2.3 GHz microwave power ampliﬁer in which the transistor is used. Characterization of breakdown was performed under DC and RF drive conditions, and shows the surprising role of impact ionization at low temperatures in DC oﬀstate breakdown, as well as the apparent prevalence of on-state breakdown under RF drive. DC characterization shows that breakdown walkout and recovery both proceed more quickly at higher temperatures, and also shows that breakdown stress might lead to the permanent creation of traps that degrade breakdown voltage. Walkout under RF drive decreases ampliﬁer gain at lower levels of RF input drive, but appears to have no negative eﬀect on ampliﬁer saturated output power. The use of temperaturecompensated input drive and a diode to clamp negative gate voltage swing are also explored as circuit design techniques that can mitigate device degradation due to breakdown stress.},

	abstract = {The primary purpose of this book is to help scientists and engineers work ing intensively with computers to become more productive, have more fun, and increase the reliability of their investigations. Scripting in the Python programming language can be a key tool for reaching these goals [27,29]. The term scripting means different things to different people. By scripting I mean developing programs of an administering nature, mostly to organize your work, using languages where the abstraction level is higher and program ming is more convenient than in Fortran, C, C++, or Java. Perl, Python, Ruby, Scheme, and Tel are examples of languages supporting such high-level programming or scripting. To some extent Matlab and similar scientific com puting environments also fall into this category, but these environments are mainly used for computing and visualization with built-in tools, while script ing aims at gluing a range of different tools for computing, visualization, data analysis, file/directory management, user interfaces, and Internet communi cation. So, although Matlab is perhaps the scripting language of choiee in computational science today, my use of the term scripting goes beyond typi cal Matlab scripts. Python stands out as the language of choice for scripting in computational science because of its very elean syntax, rieh modulariza tion features, good support for numerical computing, and rapidly growing popularity.

The distinguished author breaks down the topic by first dealing with fusion and then concentrating on the more complex subject of plasma physics. The book begins with the basics of controlled fusion research, followed by discussions on tokamaks, reversed field pinch (RFP), stellarators, and mirrors. The text then explores ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities, resistive instabilities, neoclassical tearing mode, resistive wall mode, the Boltzmann equation, the Vlasov equation, and Landau damping. After covering dielectric tensors of cold and hot plasmas, the author discusses the physical mechanisms of wave heating and noninductive current drive. The book concludes with an examination of the challenging issues of plasma transport by turbulence, such as magnetic fluctuation and zonal flow. Controlled Fusion and Plasma Physics clearly and thoroughly promotes intuitive understanding of the developments of the principal fusion programs and the relevant fundamental and advanced plasma physics associated with each program.},

Although these behaviors have been studied for many years, they are not widely used or understood in practice. Combining approaches used across the globe, Electrical Contacts: Fundamentals, Applications, and Technology integrates advances in research and development in the tribological, material, and analytical aspects of electrical contacts with new data on electrical current transfer at the micro- and nanoscales.Taking an application-oriented approach, the authors illustrate how material characteristics, tribological behavior, and loading impact the degradation of contacts, formation of intermetallics, and overall reliability and performance. Coverage is divided broadly into three sections, with the first focused on mechanics, tribology, materials, current and heat transfer, and basic reliability issues of electrical contacts. The next section explores applications, such as power connections, electronic connections, and sliding contacts, while the final section presents the diagnostic and monitoring techniques used to investigate and measure phenomena occurring at electrical contact interfaces. Numerous references to current literature reflect the fact that this book is the most comprehensive survey in the field.Explore an impressive collection of data, theory, and practical applications in Electrical Contacts: Fundamentals, Applications, and Technology, a critical tool for anyone investigating or designing electrical equipment with improved performance and reliability in mind.},

David DeVorkin, Sky \& Telescope Virginia Trimble offers readers a fascinating and accessible tour of the stars. An astronomer with shared appointments in California and Maryland, the author ranges over a large portion of the universe as she discusses the search for life on other planets, how galaxies form, why stars explode and die, and the nature of the elusive dark matter in the universe. She also explains the astronomical significance of Cheeps' pyramid and leads the reader through scientific speculation about what and when the Star of Bethlehem might have been. Throughout, Trimble points to the exciting unanswered questions that still perplex the field and considers the formidable tasks to be faced by the next generation of young astronomers.},

	abstract = {"Preface to the Second Edition Since the publication of the first edition of this book there have been some very costly system failures, which could have been prevented with a better knowledge of electrical contact phenomena. I will give two examples. The first is an electrical connector that supplied power to the "Main Fuel Shut-off Valve" in the F-16 fighter airplane. This connector used tin plated pins plugged into a gold plated socket. As will be briefly discussed in Chapters 3 and 4, the failure of this combination from fretting corrosion in the aircraft's vibration environment caused the fuel to stop flowing to the jet engines. Several F-16 crashes are attributed to this connector failure with a subsequent cost of over \$100 M. In hindsight it is probable that this pin socket combination used extensively in the earlier F-111 airplane resulted in it cancellation. Failure of the connectors most probably resulted in this plane's performance changing from a "terrain following" aircraft to a "terrain impacting" one. The second example occurred in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which began its initial testing in September 2008. Soon after it began to operate, a connection to a 12 MVA transformer failed. This cut power to the main compressors that operated the cryogenic system for cooling the super conducting magnets in two sections. This failure caused extensive wiring damage that cost more than \$20 M to repair and set back the initial operation of this expensive experimental system by about nine months"--},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT The effect of surface modes of propagation on coupling to fast waves in the LHRF is studied theoretically and experimentally. The previously reported 'updown' poloidal phasing asymmetry for coupling to a uniform plasma is shown to be due to the properties of a mode which carries energy along the plasmaconducting wall interface. Comparison of the theory with coupling experiments performed on the PLT tokamak with a phased array of twelve dielectric-loaded waveguides at 800 MHz shows that the observed dependence of the net reflection coefficient on toroidal phase angle can be explained only if the surface wave is taken into account.},

In the first chapters, general waveguide theory is presented (with the emphasis on millimeter wave applications). Next, the book systematically describes the results of both theoretical and experimental studies of rectangular dielectric rod waveguides with high dielectric permittivities. Simple and accurate methods for propagation constant calculations for isotropic as well as anisotropic dielectric waveguides are described. Both analytical and numerical approaches are covered. Different types of transitions have been simulated in order to find optimal configurations as well as optimal dimensions of dielectric waveguides for the frequency band of 75-110 GHz. Simple and effective design is presented. The experimental studies of dielectric waveguides show that Sapphire waveguide can be utilized for this frequency band as a very low-loss waveguide. Design of antennas with low return loss based on dielectric waveguides is also described.},

The subject lies at the complex interfaces between physics, chemistry and engineering. Focusing mostly on physics, this book will interest graduate students and researchers in applied physics and electrical engineering. The book incorporates a cutting-edge perspective on RF plasmas. It also covers basic plasma physics including transport in bounded plasmas and electrical diagnostics. Its pedagogic style engages readers, helping them to develop physical arguments and mathematical analyses. Worked examples apply the theories covered to realistic scenarios, and over 100 in-text questions let readers put their newly acquired knowledge to use and gain confidence in applying physics to real laboratory situations.},

This book is not a treatise on electricity and magnetism – its scope is far less ambitious. Its content can be delivered in a single-semester course, and is aimed to provide a scientifically founded and unified basis of fundamental knowledge on electromagnetic field phenomena that will help students follow up more advanced subjects covered in their courses. Topics are introduced in a systematic and friendly manner, proceeding from the simpler to more difficult ones, using a slow build-up process. In addition, a series of application examples and homework problems have been prepared to help students through the learning process. The fact that the book is partitioned into chapters does not imply that some of them can be skipped. Because the subject matter is deeply interrelated, students must try to adhere to the normal chapter sequence, otherwise they may be wasting their time or fail to get an integrated comprehensive view of the electromagnetic phenomena.},

	abstract = {The topics of anisotropy and bianisotropy are fundamental to electromagnetics from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. These properties underpin a host of complex and exotic electromagnetic phenomena in naturally occurring materials and in relativistic scenarios, as well as in artificially produced metamaterials. As a unique guide to this rapidly developing field, the book provides a unified presentation of key classic and recent results on the studies of constitutive relations, spacetime symmetries, planewave propagation, dyadic Green functions, and homogenization of composite materials. This book also offers an up-to-date extension to standard treatments of crystal optics with coverage on both linear and weakly nonlinear regimes.},

This publication is intended to provide the space community with the most recent understanding of the phenomenon of 'cold welding' in relation to spacecraft mechanisms with separable contact surfaces. It presents some basic theory and describes a test method and the required equipment. Cold welding between two contacting surfaces can occur under conditions of impact or fretting. These surfaces may be bare metals, or inorganically or organically coated metals and their alloys. Standard procedures for quantifying the propensity of material surface pairs to cold weld to each other are proposed. Of particular interest will be the contact data of different materials, which are presented in numerical form and as tables summarising contacts between materials that can be either recommended or considered unsuitable for use under vacuum. The data have been compiled in a database that can be accessed online.},

	abstract = {The book deals with the propagation and absorption of high frequency waves in plasmas. The text collects in a structured and self-contained way the basic knowledge on the broad and varied behavior of plasma waves, adopting the microscopic kinetic description of the plasma as unifying principle. The internal coherence of the theory is explicitly stressed, and interesting physical phenomena peculiar to plasmas are discussed in detail, including collisionless damping of waves, the development of stochasticity in the interactions of charged particles with electromagnetic waves, and nonlinear interactions between waves. The most common and useful approximations used in solving practical problems are derived as special cases from the more general kinetic approach, thereby clarifying their meaning and domain of applicability. This exposition should be useful to plasma physicists both as an introduction and a reference to this field of research.},

In this dissertation, a new formalism for tensor Green functions using the calculus of differential forms is proposed. Using this formalism, the scalar Green function for isotropic media is generalized to an anisotropic, inhomogeneous medium. An integral equation is obtained relating this simpler Green function to the desired Green function for the electric field, generalizing the standard technique for construction of the Green function for the isotropic case from the scalar Green function. This treatment also leads to a new integral equation for the electric field which is a direct generalization of a standard free space result. For the special case of a biaxial medium, a paraxial approximation for the Green function is used to obtain the Gaussian beam solutions. A straightforward analysis breaks down for beams propagating along two singular directions, or optical axes, so these directions are investigated specially. The associated phenomenon of internal conical refraction is know to yield a circular intensity pattern with a dark ring in its center; this analysis predicts the appearence of additional dark rings in the pattern.},

The finite element method is a numerical method that is used to solve boundary-value problems characterized by a partial differential equation and a set of boundary conditions. The geometrical domain of a boundary-value problem is discretized using sub-domain elements, called the finite elements, and the differential equation is applied to a single element after it is brought to a “weak” integro-differential form. A set of shape functions is used to represent the primary unknown variable in the element domain. A set of linear equations is obtained for each element in the discretized domain. A global matrix system is formed after the assembly of all elements. This lecture is divided into two chapters. Chapter 1 describes one-dimensional boundary-value problems with applications to electrostatic problems described by the Poisson's equation. The accuracy of the finite element method is evaluate...},

This timely and authoritative work introduces microwave engineers to the most commonly used techniques for analyzing microwave planar transmission line structures. Designed to be easily accessible to readers with only a fundamental background in electromagnetic theory, the book provides clear explanations of the theory and applications of Green's function, the conformal-mapping method, spectral domain methods, variational methods, and the mode-matching methods. Coverage for each method is self-contained and supplemented with problems and solutions as well as useful figures. In addition to providing detailed formulations of the methods under discussion, this highly practical book also demonstrates how to apply the principles of electromagnetic theory to the analysis of microwave boundary value problems, customize methods for specific needs, and develop new techniques. Analysis Methods for RF, Microwave, and Millimeter-Wave Planar Transmission Line Structures is an excellent working resource for anyone involved in the design and engineering of RF, microwave, and millimeter-wave integrated circuits.},

	isbn = {0-471-66985-7},
	abstract = {Electromagnetic metamaterials-from fundamental physics to advanced engineering applicationsThis book presents an original generalized transmission line approach associated with non-resonant structures that exhibit larger bandwidths, lower loss, and higher design flexibility. It is based on the novel concept of composite right/left-handed (CRLH) transmission line metamaterials (MMs), which has led to the development of novel guided-wave, radiated-wave, and refracted-wave devices and structures.The authors introduced this powerful new concept and are therefore able to offer readers deep insight into the fundamental physics needed to fully grasp the technology. Moreover, they provide a host of practical engineering applications.The book begins with an introductory chapter that places resonant type and transmission line metamaterials in historical perspective. The next six chapters give readers a solid foundation in the fundamentals and practical applications:* Fundamentals of LH MMs describes the fundamental physics and exotic properties of left-handed metamaterials* TL Theory of MMs establishes the foundations of CRLH structures in three progressive steps: ideal transmission line, LC network, and real distributed structure* Two-Dimensional MMs develops both a transmission matrix method and a transmission line method to address the problem of finite-size 2D metamaterials excited by arbitrary sources* Guided-Wave Applications and Radiated-Wave Applications present a number of groundbreaking applications developed by the authors* The Future of MMs sets forth an expert view on future challenges and prospectsThis engineering approach to metamaterials paves the way for a new generation of microwave and photonic devices and structures. It is recommended for electrical engineers, as well as physicists and optical engineers, with an interest in practical negative refractive index structures and materials.},
