To mitigate the associated risks, it is foreseen to design and install on ITER two port-plug antennas for a total of 20 MW coupled power on long pulse operation [1]. The CEA activity to this antenna design within the CYCLE consortium was focused on the Faraday screen design (Fig. 1) and associated radio frequency (RF) sheath modelling, the reflectometers design for edge density measurement in the antenna vicinity and a contribution to the remote handling/tooling of the antenna. This paper is an overview of each item and proposes some R\&D activities on key components.},

  abstract = {One of the key missions of the Ion Cyclotron Resonant Heating (IRCH) system for WEST is to provide sufficient RF heating power in order to obtain a heat flux on the divertor target of 10MW/m2 during 1000s and 20MW/m2 during a few tens of seconds. Based on the experience acquired in Tore Supra, the ICRH system has been upgraded for long pulse operation and Edge Localized Modes (ELM) resilience. To achieve this performance, three antennas have been designed through a European collaboration and are now under fabrication at CAS/ASIPP, at the Keye Company, Hefei, in China, within the framework of the Associated Laboratory IRFM-ASIPP. This paper describes the electrical and mechanical design of the antenna, together with the main manufacturing steps and leak test procedure used for validating the water-cooled components. Accessibility and maintenance studies on WEST have been performed with the help of virtual reality. The first ICRH antenna was delivered at Cadarache in July 2016, and is foreseen to be installed on WEST in 2017.},

Ion Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ICRH) system is one of the three heating systems which will supply total heating power of 20 MW (40-55 MHz) up to one hour of operation. Radio-Frequency (RF) contacts are integrated within the antennas for assembly and operation considerations, which will face extremely harsh service conditions, including neutron irradiation, heavy electrical loads (RF current reaches up to 2 kA with a linear current density of 4.8 kA/m) and high thermal loads. Based on the thermal analysis, the contact resistance is expected to be lower than 7 m{$\Omega$} to keep the maximum temperature on the louvers lower than 250\textdegree{}C. Few weeks of vacuum ( 10-5Pa) baking at 250\textdegree{}C for outgassing is expected before each plasma experimental campaign, under which the RF contact materials' mechanical properties change and diffusion phenomena between different materials are inevitable. CuCrZr and 316L are proper base materials for ITER RF contact louvers and conductors respectively. In order to improve the RF contact's wear and corrosion resistivity as well as to reduce the contact resistance, Au-Ni and Rh functional layers could be electroplated on CuCrZr and 316L accordingly. The application of the Au-Ni/Rh coating pairs is assessed through the thermal ageing and diffusion tests. Wear and electrical contact performances of the Au-Ni/Rh pairs are deeply studied on a dedicated tribometer operated at ITER relevant conditions.},

For these applications, Rh coated CuCrZr components subject to long time of thermal ageing due to pre-treatment or normal operation condition. In this paper, both finite element method (FEM) and experimental method were applied to investigate the effects of thermal ageing on mechanical performance of Rh coating after 250 \textdegree{}C, 500 h baking in vacuum. Based on FEM analysis, thermal stresses which concentrate at Rh coating interface is the main source of cracking, and such stresses can be minimized efficiently by introducing a 0.5 {$\mu$}m Au interlayer into the coating layer structure. According to thermal ageing experiments, through-thickness cracking in the Rh coating due to thermal stress releasing and voids generated at the Rh bonding interface caused by Kirkendall effect were the main micro-structure changes in the coating system. The solid-solution hardening caused by significant Cu diffusion into Rh is the dominant factor that affected the Rh coating's hardness. The existing of large amount of cracks in the Rh coating and voids at the Rh coating interface deteriorated the adhesion performance of Rh on CuCrZr substrate by 30\%.},

  abstract = {We investigate theoretically how sheath radio-frequency (RF) oscillations relate to the spatial structure of the near RF parallel electric field E{$\parallel$} emitted by ion cyclotron (IC) wave launchers. We use a simple model of slow wave (SW) evanescence coupled with direct current (DC) plasma biasing via sheath boundary conditions in a 3D parallelepiped filled with homogeneous cold magnetized plasma. Within a `wide-sheath' asymptotic regime, valid for large-amplitude near RF fields, the RF part of this simple RF\,\,+\,\,DC model becomes linear: the sheath oscillating voltage VRF at open field line boundaries can be re-expressed as a linear combination of individual contributions by every emitting point in the input field map. SW evanescence makes individual contributions all the larger as the wave emission point is located closer to the sheath walls. The decay of |VRF| with the emission point/sheath poloidal distance involves the transverse SW evanescence length and the radial protrusion depth of lateral boundaries. The decay of |VRF| with the emitter/sheath parallel distance is quantified as a function of the parallel SW evanescence length and the parallel connection length of open magnetic field lines. For realistic geometries and target SOL plasmas, poloidal decay occurs over a few centimeters. Typical parallel decay lengths for |VRF| are found to be smaller than IC antenna parallel extension. Oscillating sheath voltages at IC antenna side limiters are therefore mainly sensitive to E{$\parallel$} emission by active or passive conducting elements near these limiters, as suggested by recent experimental observations. Parallel proximity effects could also explain why sheath oscillations persist with antisymmetric strap toroidal phasing, despite the parallel antisymmetry of the radiated field map. They could finally justify current attempts at reducing the RF fields induced near antenna boxes to attenuate sheath oscillations in their vicinity.},

We recall the PML formulation as an artificial inhomogeneous lossy medium, following the stretching into the complex plane of a general system of three orthogonal curvilinear coordinates. We apply the general method in cylindrical and toroidal geometries. We then assess this technique in a simple case combining gyrotropy and coordinate curvature. Our test problem analytically quantifies the reflection of Transverse Electric (TE) cylindrical eigenmodes in a gyrotropic medium by a radial PML in cylindrical geometry. The obtained reflection coefficient involves wave, PML and geometric parameters at the PML location. The new coefficient generalizes the one obtained earlier with Cartesian coordinates, and becomes equivalent when the effects of the local cylindrical curvature at the PML (stretched) location can be neglected. These curvature effects are outlined and the limitations they impose on the properties of the PML are quantified as a function of the relevant parameters. Peculiarities related to the gyrotropy are also highlighted. Finite element calculations of the test problem in two-dimensional cylindrical geometry are exploited to verify these properties numerically. Indications are finally given on how to choose the PML parameters in order to obtain a minimal wave reflection at given numerical cost, taking into account errors associated with the numerical scheme.},

The sensitivity of LHCD to density and temperature profiles is calculated. From the simulation results, an optimum value for the parallel index of refraction is proposed as a compromise between efficiency and robustness with respect to those profile variations.

  abstract = {Lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) is an effective tool to achieve high confinement (H-mode) plasma in EAST. To utilize LHCD for accessing H-mode plasma, efforts have been made to improve LHW (lower hybrid wave)-plasma coupling and current drive capability at high density. Improved LHW-plasma coupling by means of local gas puffing and gas puffing from the electron side is routinely used during EAST operation with LHCD. High density experiments suggest that low recycling and high LH frequency are preferred for LHCD experiments at high density, consistent with previous results in other machines. The effect of LHCD on the current profile in EAST demonstrates that it is possible to control the plasma profile by optimizing the LHW spectrum. Repeatable H-mode plasma was obtained by LHCD and the maximum density during H-mode with the combination of 2.45 GHz and 4.6 GHz LH waves was up to 4.5\,\,\texttimes\,\,1019 m-3.},

  abstract = {A new ITER-relevant lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) launcher, based on the passive-active-multijunction (PAM) concept, was brought into operation on the Tore Supra tokamak in autumn 2009. The PAM launcher concept was designed in view of ITER to allow efficient cooling of the waveguides, as required for long pulse operation. In addition, it offers low power reflection close to the cut-off density, which is very attractive for ITER, where the large distance between the plasma and the wall may bring the density in front of the launcher to low values. The first experimental campaign on Tore Supra has shown extremely encouraging results in terms of reflected power level and power handling. Power reflection coefficient {$<$}2\% is obtained at low density in front of the launcher, i.e. close to the cut-off density, and very good agreement between the experimental results and the coupling code predictions is obtained. Long pulse operation at ITER-relevant power density has been demonstrated. The maximum power and energy reached so far is 2.7 MW during 78 s, corresponding to a power density of 25 MW m-2, i.e. its design value at f = 3.7 GHz. In addition, 2.7 MW has been coupled at a plasma\textendash{}launcher distance of 10 cm, with a power reflection coefficient {$<$}2\%. Finally, full non-inductive discharges have been sustained for 50 s with the PAM.},

  abstract = {The power handling capacity of RF components can be limited by a resonant process known as Multipactor effect. Multipactor-induced breakdowns can be critical to microwave systems in space communication payloads or in experimental fusion devices. Multipactor simulations can be used to predict power thresholds but the results highly depend on the electron emission properties of the RF component materials. Moreover, in both space and fusion applications, the RF devices can be subjected to DC magnetic fields. This magnetic field may affect the electron emission properties. In order to improve understanding and predictability of the multipactor effect, the assessment of DC magnetic field on the electron emission properties is required; an experimental setup has been developed to measure the Total Electron Emission Yield (TEEY) under DC magnetic field. The aim of this paper is to describe the newly developed experimental setup and the associated TEEY measurements techniques. The effect of DC magnetic field on the TEEY of copper is investigated.},

  abstract = {Multipactor is a resonance effect between the RF electric field and the motion of the electrons which can decrease the performance of Radio-Frequency (RF) systems functioning under vacuum [1]. It highly depends on the electron emission properties of the RF component materials. Applications using these kind of components are telecommunication satellite [2], fusion experimental reactors with Tokamak [3] or particle accelerators [4] among others. Many experimental [5] and theoretical [6]\textendash{}[9] works have been conducted to study this undesirable phenomenon. The aim of these approaches is to determine the multipactor power threshold. Above this threshold, multipactor can appears and eventually damage RF systems. In some applications concerned by the multipactor effect, RF components are submitted to DC magnetic fields. For instance, in telecommunication satellite, magnetic fields of a few tenths of Tesla produced with permanent magnets are used in circulators and isolators. In fusion reactors, rectangular copper waveguides are located under intense magnetic fields of few Tesla generated by toroidal and poloidal coils. Multipactor simulations codes are used to calculate the threshold that would trigger the electron density growth by following the electrons under the RF wave electromagnetic field [7], [8]. Multipactor modeling can also take into account an external magnetic field, which induces gyratory motions of electrons within the simulated RF structure. Studies have been made on the effect of external magnetic field on multipactor discharge [10]. However, to our knowledge, there are no multipactor simulation codes which consider the influence of DC magnetic field on the electron emission process itself. Electron emission due to an incident electron beam is a phenomenon which lies on the surface first tens of nanometer [11]. Then the Total Electron Emission Yield (TEEY) highly depends on surface condition (topography, contaminants adsorbed) and surface treatment (drying, irradiation, erosion) [11]\textendash{}[15]. The presence of a uniform DC magnetic field influences the electrons trajectories by giving them cylindrical helix trajectories depending on the direction of the magnetic field as well as on the energy of the electrons. To study the effect of the magnetic field on the TEEY, a new experimental setup has been developed. A special attention to the design of the experimental setup and to the choice of the measurement methodology has been taken to circumvent the possible artefacts that are related to the high sensitivity of incoming and emitted electrons trajectories to the DC magnetic field. The new developed experimental setup and the measurement methods are described in details in [16] as well as the validation procedure of the TEEY measurement methodology based on both experiments and modelling with SPIS code [17]. In this paper TEEY measurements on copper under a DC magnetic field perpendicular to the sample surface are presented. We have studied various surface morphologies such as laminated and polished and have observed TEEY increase as well as decrease depending on the magnetic field amplitude and the surface morphology [18]. With incident electron at first cross-over energy (EC1), DC magnetic field has a greater influence on the laminate surface than the polished one (respectively TEEY decreased to 45\% and 5\%). Such impact of the magnetic field is discussed in regards of multipactor effect simulations codes.},

At low power good agreement between the measurement of the power reflection coefficient and the computation with the ALOHA code is found for most cases. Details on electron density measurements, documented from embedded Langmuir probes, are discussed. At high power, departure from the linear theory is clearly seen in many cases. Ponderomotive forces depleting the electron density in a thin plasma layer in front of the antennas are likely to be responsible for the increase of power reflection coefficients measured at the input of the antennas. The decrease of the antenna directivity resulting from weaker wave coupling accounts for the experimental reduction of current drive efficiency.},

The limitations, in particular in H-mode plasmas, are discussed and the performance compared with other LHCD experiments using multijunctions as power dividers. Although the power density of 25 MW m-2 has been exceeded in L-mode and almost obtained in ELMy H-mode (on 1/6th of the antenna), it is concluded that the RF conditioning performed on JET does not allow us to exceed an electric field of {$\sim$}5.5 kV cm-1 which is generally not sufficient under the rather weak coupling conditions of the JET H-mode. Modelling of an arc occurring in a waveguide indicates that rather small variations of the reflected wave (amplitude and phase) may occur, rendering arc detection based on RF measurements difficult in some cases. The JET bolometry diagnostic with four chords viewing the antenna front is found to be an efficient tool to detect an arc. In L-mode plasmas, a very good correlation between the amplitude of the bolometry signals and the iron spectroscopic lines is found. In H-mode the arc detection is clearly more difficult with enhanced radiation during the ELM but is still possible when the bolometry signals are properly processed.},

  abstract = {Multipactor, the well-known electron avalanche phenomena occurring in waveguides when the amplitude of the RF electric field exceeds a threshold, is modelled for lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) antennas. The electric field threshold departures significantly from the expected linear scaling with the frequency when the width of the waveguide along the electric field increases. For 5 GHz waveguides, the multipactor does not occur when this width exceeds 26 mm, in very good agreement with analytical formulation. Effect of static magnetic field with typical values of tokamak environment is examined. It is found that the threshold is weakly reduced (-6\%) for the front face of the antenna featuring the rows of narrow waveguides. Strong reduction in the threshold is found where the wave frequency equals the electron cyclotron frequency (0.178 T at 5 GHz) but this condition will not be met on ITER. After baking at 240 {$\smwhtcircle$}C, wide waveguides at the antenna input (29 mm on ITER) have a threshold of {$\sim$}7 kV cm-1, assuming a homogeneous magnetic field. However, preliminary results indicate higher threshold when the gradient of the magnetic field along the waveguide is taken into account and no limitation, from this section, is expected for the ITER LHCD antenna.},

  abstract = {This year, TORE-SUPRA celebrated 25 years of operation. During this time, a number of technologies have been developed. First of all, it was mandatory to develop reliable superconducting magnets at {$\sim$}1.8 K, with superfluid helium as an efficient coolant. For the production of steady-state discharge, three types of radio-frequency (RF) additional heating systems have been developed: lower hybrid current drive, ions and electrons cyclotron resonance heating. To cope with long-lasting discharges (up to 380 s\texttimes{}2.8 MW) and large RF additional heating power (12.3 MW\texttimes{}3 s), actively cooled (AC) plasma facing components were deployed in TORE-SUPRA for the first time in a tokamak environment. TORE-SUPRA is now being modified into a D-shaped axisymmetric tokamak with AC main chamber walls and an AC tungsten divertor, the W\textemdash{}for tungsten\textemdash{}Environment in Steady-state tokamak (WEST). This new facility has the objective to offer ITER a test bed for validating the relevant AC metallic technologies in D-shaped H-mode plasmas. In contrast to other metallic devices such as JET and ASDEX upgrade, WEST will rely only on RF additional power systems. A set of plasma scenarios have been identified, ranging from a high total RF power scenario up to 15 MW\textendash{}30 s, to a high fluence scenario of 1000 s with up to 10 MW of injected RF power. These scenarios are able to reproduce ITER-relevant conditions of steady-state heat loads of 10\textendash{}20 MW/m2, to test tungsten AC divertor technologies with relevant power heat fluxes and particle fluence.},

  abstract = {The Advanced LOwer Hybrid Antenna (ALOHA) code, has been developed to improve the modelling of the coupling of lower hybrid (LH) waves from the antenna to a cold inhomogeneous plasma while keeping a fast tool. In contrast to the previous code Slow Wave ANtenna (SWAN) (that only described the interaction of the slow wave between the waveguides and the plasma in a 1D model), the equations are now solved in 2D including the contribution of both the slow and fast waves, with a low computational cost. This approach is completed either by a full-wave computation of the antenna that takes into account its detailed geometry or by a mode-matching code dedicated to multijunctions modelling, which is convenient in preliminary design phases. Moreover, ALOHA can treat more realistic scrape-off layers in front of the antenna, by using a two-layer electron density profile. The ALOHA code has been compared with experimental results from Tore Supra LH antennas of different geometries, as well as benchmarked against other LH coupling codes, with very good results. Once validated, ALOHA has been used as a support for the design of COMPASS and ITER LH antennas and has shown to be a fast and reliable tool for LH antenna design.},

Lower Hybrid Current Drive (LHCD) is currently the most efficient method to generate a continuous additional off-axis toroidal plasma current as well as reduce the poloidal flux consumption during the plasma current ramp-up phase. The operation of the Tore Supra ITER-like LH launcher and 700kW CW klystrons have demonstrated the ability to couple LH power at ITER-like power densities with very low reflected power during long pulses. However, in order to achieve pure stationary LH sustained plasmas, some R\&D are needed to increase the reliability of all the systems and codes, from the RF sources to the plasma scenario prediction. The CEA/IRFM is addressing some of these issues by leading a R\&D program toward an ITER LH system and by the validation of an integrated LH modeling suite of codes. In 2011, the RF design of a mode converter has been validated at low power. A 500 kW/5 s RF window is currently under manufacturing and will be tested at high power in 2012 in collaboration with NFRI. All of this work aims to reduce the operational risks associated with the ITER steady-state operations.},

The window design rely on a symmetrical pill-box concept with a cylindrical beryllium oxide ceramic brazed on an actively water cooled copper skirt. The ceramic RF properties have been measured on a test sample to get realistic values for guiding the design. Low power measurements of the manufactured windows show return losses below -32 dB and insertion losses between -0.01 dB and -0.05 dB, with an optimum frequency shifted toward lower frequencies. High power tests conducted at NFRI show unexpected total power loss for both windows. The ceramic temperature during RF pulses has been found to reach unexpected high temperature, preventing these windows to be used under CW conditions. A post-mortem RF analysis of samples taken from one window shows that the dielectric properties of the ceramic were not the ones measured on the manufacturer sample, which partly explain the differences with the reference modelling.},

The contacts have to sustain a temperature up to 250 {$\smwhtcircle$}C during several days in baking operations and have to be reliable during the whole life of the launcher without degradation. The RF contacts are critical components for the launcher performance and intensive R\&D is therefore required, since no RF contacts have so far been qualified at these specifications. In order to test and validate the anticipated RF contacts in operational conditions, CEA has prepared a test platform consisting of a steady-state vacuum pumped RF resonator. In collaboration with ITER Organization and the CYCLE consortium (CYclotron CLuster for Europe), an R\&D program has been conducted to develop RF contacts that meet the ITER ICRH launcher specifications. A design proposed by CYCLE consortium, using brazed lamellas supported by a spring to improve thermal exchange efficiency while guaranteeing high contact force, was tested successfully in the Tresonator up to 1.7 kA during 1200 s, but failed for larger current values due to a degradation of the contacts.

  abstract = {Magnetic confinement fusion researches are an approach to demonstrate the feasibility of nuclear fusion power for energy production. In these experiments, mega-watt range power Radio-Frequency waves, from tens of MHz to hundreds of GHz, are injected into magnetically confined plasmas in order to increase its temperature and to extend its duration. These RF systems are subjected to the magnetic field environment of the experiments, ranging from few tenth of Tesla to Tesla, and various orientations depending of their locations. As these RF systems made of copper, silver or ceramics are located in vacuum environments, they are subject to multipactor discharges. These discharges are generally considered detrimental since they can lead to detuned RF systems, limit the RF power transmission in the plasma and eventually damage RF sources or components. In some case, especially in the MHz range of frequency, multipactor discharges can be desired for vacuum conditioning. This paper presents the various RF systems used in magnetic fusion experiments and review the work performed in the fusion research community on multipactor discharges for high power coaxial (MHz) and rectangular waveguides (GHz) transmission lines, with their practical implications on power delivery into the plasma.},

A material study has been carried out to determine which materials and associated coatings are relevant for RF contacts application in ITER. In parallel, RF tests have been performed with a new prototype of Multi-Contact\textregistered{} LA-CUT/0,25/0 contacts made of silver-coated CuCrZr louvers. During these tests on a RF vacuum resonator, currents between 1.2 kA and 1.3 kA peak have been reached a few tens of times in steady-state conditions without any visible damage on the louvers. A final 62 MHz pulse ending in a 300 s flat top at 1.9 kA resulted in severe damage to the contact. In addition, a test bed which performs sliding test cycles has been built in order to reproduce the wear of the contact prototype after 30 000 sliding cycles on a 3 mm stroke at 175 \textdegree{}C under vacuum. The silver coating of the louvers is removed after approximately a hundred cycles whilst, to the contrary, damage to the CuCrZr louvers is relatively low.},

These antenna coupling codes often approximate the plasma to a surface impedance described by a 1D half infinite models and antennas either with simplified 2D dimensions or from 3D CAD models conversion. Such approaches add an additional step of model approximation/conversion which is not convenient to rapidly assess impact of geometry changes on coupling performances. In this work, we assess the ability of using ANSYS HFSS to describe the usual range of experimental magnetized cold plasma inhomogeneous parameters facing LHRF antennas, away from resonances, in order to guide the RF designer during the design phase of an antenna. The coupling calculations of Lower Hybrid Resonance Frequency antennas are performed and successfully benchmarked with the fast coupling codes ALOHA on inhomogeneous cold magnetized plasmas. Good agreements are obtained when the boundary conditions in the full-wave modelling are properly handled.

Such kinds of RF systems being rather rare, master students do not know how these systems are done in practice, even students engaged in nuclear fusion courses. This is the reason why, as part of the French and European masters in fusion physics and technologies, dedicated practical work on topics related to plasma RF heating are proposed to students. During few days, these students discover how to perform RF measurements and succeed in characterizing real-scale components used in plasma RF heating experiments. This paper details four hands-on which have been conducted for eight years with few tens of students having no prior knowledge in RF engineering.},

It is applied in the commercial software COMSOL Multiphysics. Its main features include the perfectly matched layer (PML) technique to emulate radiating boundary conditions beyond a critical cutoff layer for the fast wave (FW), full-wave propagation across the inhomogeneous cold peripheral plasma and a detailed description of the wave launcher geometry. The PML technique, while widely used in numerical simulations of wave propagation, has scarcely been used for magnetized plasmas, due to specificities of this gyrotropic material. A versatile PML formulation, valid for full dielectric tensors, is summarized and interpreted as wave propagation in an artificial medium. The behavior of this technique has been checked for plane waves on homogeneous plasmas. Wave reflection has been quantified and compared to analytical predictions. An incompatibility issue for adapting the PML for forward (FW) and backward (slow wave (SW)) propagating waves simultaneously has been evidenced. In a tokamak plasma, this critical issue is overcome by taking advantage of the inhomogeneous density profile to reflect the SW before it reaches the PML. The simulated coupling properties of a Tore Supra ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH) antenna have been compared to experimental values in a situation of good single-pass absorption. The necessary antenna elements to include in the geometry to recover the coupling properties obtained experimentally are also discussed.},

Using parallel electric field maps and the scattering matrix produced by RAPLICASOL, SSWICH-SW, reduced to its asymptotic part, is able to produce a 2D radial/poloidal map of the DC plasma potential accounting for the antenna input settings (total power, power balance, phasing). Two models of antennas are compared: 2-strap antenna vs 3-strap antenna. The 2D DC potential structures are correlated to structures of the parallel electric field map for different phasing and power balance. The overall DC plasma potential on the 3-strap antenna is lower due to better global RF currents compensation. Spatial proximity between regions of high RF electric field and regions where high DC plasma potentials are observed is an important factor for sheath rectification.},

Amplitude-balanced broadband responses were obtained with the combination of impedance reductions of longitudinal and transverse branches in unequal proportion, length change of 50 lines and diameter change of high impedance lines connected transversely to the T-section of the hybrid splitter, respectively. We have fabricated and RF tested the 9 in. coaxial hybrid coupler. We obtained an excellent coupling flatness of -3.2 {$\pm$} 0.2 dB, phase difference of 4 degrees and return loss of 16 dB in 40\textendash{}55 MHz. The measured data of 9 in. hybrid splitter is highly consistent with HFSS simulations. We found that the proposed 3 dB hybrid splitter can be tunable with amplitude-balanced, broadband response by changing dielectric insulators to keep the inner and outer conductors of coaxial line apart. The proposed 3 dB hybrid splitter can be utilized for load-resilient operations in a wide range of antenna load variations due to mode transitions or edge localized modes (ELMs) in fusion plasmas.},

The antenna includes a PAM launcher, bidirectional couplers, power dividing components, and two RF windows. The RF characteristics of each component, such as the splitting ratio, phase shift, transmission, and reflection, were measured using a network analyzer. A taper adapter and matched load, which can be inserted into the active waveguide of the PAM mouth, were designed and fabricated for the phase shift and power coupling measurement. The maximum error and the standard deviation of measured phase shifts between adjacent active waveguides of the PAM were 6.5\textdegree{} and 2.28\textdegree, respectively. The design improvement of the mid-plane PAM launcher is suggested. Multiple round trips of the reflected field in a multijunction provides the advantage of lowering the reflection but, at the same time, it causes the deterioration of directivity and an increase of the electric field in the waveguide. Adding a hybrid splitter at the end of the multijunction structure reduces the reflection by redirecting the reflection to plasma as in multijunction, however, contrary to the multijunction, it does not switch the toroidal direction of phase progression and thus improves the antenna directivity. The directivity of the hybrid PAM increases by more than 10\% and the reflection decreases to 1/3\textendash{}1/ 100 in comparison with the prototype PAM.},

  abstract = {Detailed designs of ICRF antennas were made possible by the development of sophisticated commercial 3D codes like CST Microwave Studio R (MWS). This program allows for very detailed geometries of the radiating structures, but was only considering simple materials like equivalent isotropic dielectrics to simulate the reflection and the refraction of RF waves at the vacuum/plasma interface. The code was nevertheless used intensively, notably for computing the coupling properties of the ITER ICRF antenna. Until recently it was not possible to simulate gyrotropic medias like magnetized plasmas, but recent improvements have allowed programming any material described by a general dielectric or/and diamagnetic tensor. A Visual Basic macro was developed to exploit this feature and was tested for the specific case of a monochromatic plane wave propagating longitudinally with respect to the magnetic field direction. For specific cases the exact solution can be expressed in 1D as the sum of two circularly polarized waves connected by a reflection coefficient that can be analytically computed. Solutions for stratified media can also be derived. This allows for a direct comparison with MWS results. The agreement is excellent but accurate simulations for realistic geometries require large memory resources that could significantly restrict the possibility of simulating cold plasmas to small-scale machines.},

  abstract = {In order to model the sheath rectification in a realistic geometry over the size of ion cyclotron resonant heating (ICRH) antennas, the self-consistent sheaths and waves for ICH (SSWICH) code couples self-consistently the RF wave propagation and the DC SOL biasing via nonlinear RF and DC sheath boundary conditions applied at plasma/wall interfaces. A first version of SSWICH had 2D (toroidal and radial) geometry, rectangular walls either normal or parallel to the confinement magnetic field B0 and only included the evanescent slow wave (SW) excited parasitically by the ICRH antenna. The main wave for plasma heating, the fast wave (FW) plays no role on the sheath excitation in this version. A new version of the code, 2D SSWICH-full wave, was developed based on the COMSOL software, to accommodate full RF field polarization and shaped walls tilted with respect to B0. SSWICH-full wave simulations have shown the mode conversion of FW into SW occurring at the sharp corners where the boundary shape varies rapidly. It has also evidenced `far-field' sheath oscillations appearing at the shaped walls with a relatively long magnetic connection length to the antenna, that are only accessible to the propagating FW. Joint simulation, conducted by SSWICH-full wave within a multi-2D approach excited using the 3D wave coupling code (RAPLICASOL), has recovered the double-hump poloidal structure measured in the experimental temperature and potential maps when only the SW is modelled. The FW contribution on the potential poloidal structure seems to be affected by the 3D effects, which was ignored in the current stage. Finally, SSWICH-full wave simulation revealed the left\textendash{}right asymmetry that has been observed extensively in the unbalanced strap feeding experiments, suggesting that the spatial proximity effects in RF sheath excitation, studied for SW only previously, is still important in the vicinity of the wave launcher under full wave polarizations.},

  abstract = {Fully non-inductive operation with lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) in the Tore Supra tokamak is achieved using either a fully active multijunction (FAM) launcher or a more recent ITER-relevant passive active multijunction (PAM) launcher, or both launchers simultaneously. While both antennas show comparable experimental efficiencies, the analysis of stability properties in long discharges suggest different current profiles. We present comparative modelling of LHCD with the two different launchers to characterize the effect of the respective antenna spectra on the driven current profile. The interpretative modelling of LHCD is carried out using a chain of codes calculating, respectively, the global discharge evolution (tokamak simulator METIS), the spectrum at the antenna mouth (LH coupling code ALOHA), the LH wave propagation (ray-tracing code C3PO), and the distribution function (3D Fokker\textendash{}Planck code LUKE). Essential aspects of the fast electron dynamics in time, space and energy are obtained from hard x-ray measurements of fast electron bremsstrahlung emission using a dedicated tomographic system. LHCD simulations are validated by systematic comparisons between these experimental measurements and the reconstructed signal calculated by the code R5X2 from the LUKE electron distribution. An excellent agreement is obtained in the presence of strong Landau damping (found under low density and high-power conditions in Tore Supra) for which the ray-tracing model is valid for modelling the LH wave propagation. Two aspects of the antenna spectra are found to have a significant effect on LHCD. First, the driven current is found to be proportional to the directivity, which depends upon the respective weight of the main positive and main negative lobes and is particularly sensitive to the density in front of the antenna. Second, the position of the main negative lobe in the spectrum is different for the two launchers. As this lobe drives a counter-current, the resulting driven current profile is also different for the FAM and PAM launchers.},

  abstract = {During tokamak operation with lower hybrid (LH) power a few per cent of the launched power is absorbed by the scrape-off layer plasma in magnetic flux tubes in front of the LH grill. At strike points of these flux tubes, intense plasma\textendash{}wall interaction is seen in visible and infrared wavelengths, and local wall damage can occur. The parallel power flux within these `hot spots' is estimated to be up to about 10 MW m-2 by infrared imagery. Recent experimental results from retarding field analyzer measurements on Tore Supra as well as JET IR camera measurements have shown the existence of fast electrons as far as a few centimeters from the grill mouth. This finding cannot be explained by the standard theory. We present therefore in this paper a novel theory explaining the fast electron generation in a several cm wide layer in front of the LH grill by taking into account LH wave propagation features closely connected with the blob character of edge turbulence. We demonstrate that the computed power-flows then essentially agree with data from infrared diagnostics. An alternative theoretical explanation considers plasma density modulations due to ponderomotive force effects in front of the LH grill.},

This was achieved by implementing the scattering matrix formalism. The extended code is still computationally fast by the use of 2D splining of the plasma surface admittance in the accessibility region of the k-space, by the use of high order Gaussian quadrature rules for the integration of the coupling elements and by the application of the symmetry rules of the coupling elements for the multiperiodic structures. We successfully benchmark the coupling of the C3 and C4 launchers as determined OLGA with the 1D ALOHA results for several plasma configuration derived from reflectometric and interferometeric measurement of the density profile during a TORE SUPRA discharge. We found that OLGA and ALOHA gives the same results for the case of supercritical plasma density at the grill mouth. For subcritical densities in the front of grill ALOHA results are unreliable.},

  abstract = {A new concept of lower hybrid antenna for current drive has been proposed for ITER (Bibet et al 1995 Nucl. Fusion 35 1213\textendash{}23): the passive active multijunction (PAM) antenna that relies on a periodic combination of active and passive waveguides. An actively cooled PAM antenna at 3.7 GHz has recently been installed on the tokamak Tore Supra. This paper summarizes the comprehensive experimental characterization of the coupling properties of the PAM antenna to the Tore Supra plasmas. In this paper, the electromagnetic properties of the antenna are measured at a reduced power ({$<$}1 MW) to allow a systematic comparison with linear wave coupling theory and the associated modelling based on the linear ALOHA code. In a wide range of edge electron densities at the antenna aperture (spanning a factor 20 from 0.5 \texttimes{} nc to 10 \texttimes{} nc where nc is the slow wave density cut-off, nc = 1.7 \texttimes{} 1017 m-3 at 3.7 GHz) and antenna phasing, the ALOHA simulations reproduce the experimental results observed on Tore Supra. In addition, reduced power reflection coefficients ({$<$}5\%) are measured at a low edge density, close to nc, i.e. in the range 0.5\textendash{}3 \texttimes{} nc. Measurement and analysis with ALOHA of the antenna\textendash{}plasma scattering matrices provide explanation of the good coupling properties of the PAM antenna close to nc by highlighting the crucial role of the slow wave intercoupling between active and passive waveguides through the plasma edge. This detailed validation of the coupling modelling is an important step towards the validation of the PAM concept in view of further optimizing the electromagnetic properties of the future ITER antenna.},

  abstract = {To achieve steady-state operation on future fusion devices, in particular on ITER, the coupling of the lower hybrid wave must be optimized on a wide range of edge conditions. However, under some specific conditions, deleterious effects on the lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) coupling are sometimes observed on Tore Supra. In this way, dedicated LHCD experiments have been performed using the LHCD system of Tore Supra, composed of two different conceptual designs of launcher: the fully active multi-junction (FAM) and the new passive active multijunction (PAM) antennas. A non-linear interaction between the electron density and the electric field has been characterized in a thin plasma layer in front of the two LHCD antennas. The resulting dependence of the power reflection coefficient (RC) with the LHCD power is not predicted by the standard linear theory of the LH wave coupling. A theoretical model is suggested to describe the non-linear wave\textendash{}plasma interaction induced by the ponderomotive effect and implemented in a new full wave LHCD code, PICCOLO-2D (ponderomotive effect in a coupling code of lower hybrid wave-2D). The code self-consistently treats the wave propagation in the antenna vicinity and its interaction with the local edge plasma density. The simulation reproduces very well the occurrence of a non-linear behaviour in the coupling observed in the LHCD experiments. The important differences and trends between the FAM and the PAM antennas, especially a larger increase in RC for the FAM, are also reproduced by the PICCOLO-2D simulation. The working hypothesis of the contribution of the ponderomotive effect in the non-linear observations of LHCD coupling is therefore validated through this comprehensive modelling for the first time on the FAM and PAM antennas on Tore Supra.},

  abstract = {Travelling Wave Array (TWA) antennas distributed along the periphery of the tokamak are presently considered as Ion Cyclotron Resonance Frequencies (ICRF) heating solution for the DEMO reactor. Compared to the conventional ICRF antenna systems currently in use or designed for future machines like ITER, the TWA consists of antenna sections integrated in the breeding blanket scattered around the machine, each one fed through a variable coupler in a resonant ring configuration. Previous modelling of an antenna system for DEMO with 16 quadruple TWA sections of 8 straps shows that a power capability exceeding 50 MW can be obtained in the frequency band of interest using the reference low coupling plasma profile of ITER. The described system optimizes the coupling to the plasma by providing a large number of radiating elements, which results in enhanced antenna directivity hereby decreasing the antenna power density. This results in a maximum strap voltage amplitude of only 15 kV and maximum inter-strap voltage amplitude of 18 kV. The generators remain matched for all loading conditions: the system is totally load resilient. Following the recommendation of the work package heating and current drive (WPHCD) Review Panel, a TWA ICRH system consisting in fewer sections concentrated in front of the equatorial ports is analysed in this paper and compared to the previous design. Reducing the number of sections increases the power density and its associated voltages. To couple 50 MW on the ITER density profile, voltages up to 30 kV are now required. Some aspects like the coupling between sections and its repercussion on the feeding network are briefly discussed. To assess the feasibility of the TWA fed by a resonant ring as ICRH system for a DEMO reactor, a test on an existing medium size tokamak is under study.},

  abstract = {Tore Supra routinely addresses the physics and technology of very long-duration plasma discharges, thus bringing precious information on critical issues of long pulse operation of ITER. A new ITER relevant lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) launcher has allowed coupling to the plasma a power level of 2.7 MW for 78 s, corresponding to a power density close to the design value foreseen for an ITER LHCD system. In accordance with the expectations, long distance (10 cm) power coupling has been obtained. Successive stationary states of the plasma current profile have been controlled in real-time featuring (i) control of sawteeth with varying plasma parameters, (ii) obtaining and sustaining a `hot core' plasma regime, (iii) recovery from a voluntarily triggered deleterious magnetohydrodynamic regime. The scrape-off layer (SOL) parameters and power deposition have been documented during L-mode rampup phase, a crucial point for ITER before the X-point formation. Disruption mitigation studies have been conducted with massive gas injection, evidencing the difference between He and Ar and the possible role of the q = 2 surface in limiting the gas penetration. ICRF assisted wall conditioning in the presence of magnetic field has been investigated, culminating in the demonstration that this conditioning scheme allows one to recover normal operation after disruptions. The effect of the magnetic field ripple on the intrinsic plasma rotation has been studied, showing the competition between turbulent transport processes and ripple toroidal friction. During dedicated dimensionless experiments, the effect of varying the collisionality on turbulence wavenumber spectra has been documented, giving new insight into the turbulence mechanism. Turbulence measurements have also allowed quantitatively comparing experimental results with predictions by 5D gyrokinetic codes: numerical results simultaneously match the magnitude of effective heat diffusivity, rms values of density fluctuations and wavenumber spectra. A clear correlation between electron temperature gradient and impurity transport in the very core of the plasma has been observed, strongly suggesting the existence of a threshold above which transport is dominated by turbulent electron modes. Dynamics of edge turbulent fluctuations has been studied by correlating data from fast imaging cameras and Langmuir probes, yielding a coherent picture of transport processes involved in the SOL.},

  abstract = {A simple and comprehensive method is derived and used to quantify the impact of scaling laws on tokamak reactor dimensioning. Assuming prescribed geometrical coefficients, we find the ensemble of possible triplets R, B and normalized beta which allow one to reach target fusion gain Q and fusion power , at an arbitrary Greenwald fraction. The model is generic and derived for any scaling law of the energy confinement time. Using the IPB98(y,2) scaling law (ITER Physics Expert Group on Confinement and Transport and Confinement Modeling and Database and ITER Physics Basis Editors 1999 Nucl. Fusion 39 2175) leads to ITER specifications, as expected. The recently proposed new scaling law for H-mode plasmas (DS03, (Sips et al 2018 Nucl. Fusion 58 126010)) is shown to lead to modest changes to the dimensioning, except for B which could be significantly smaller for the same target performance. The impact on the dimensioning of critical exponents of the scaling law\textemdash{}both regarding engineer and dimensionless variables\textemdash{}is assessed, pushing for their determination with refined accuracy. Finally, the method is applied to a DEMO-like machine. The DS03 scaling law is found to have favorable consequences on the dimensioning as compared to IPB98(y,2), provided one is able to operate at larger , which can reveal challenging in a reactor aiming at zero disruption. Importantly, the opposite scaling of both scaling laws with respect to the aspect ratio are shown to have significant consequences on the optimal choice of this critical parameter.},

  abstract = {A newly developed generic electro-magnetic (EM) simulation tool for modeling RF wave propagation in SOL plasmas is presented. The primary motivation of this development is to extend the domain partitioning approach for incorporating arbitrarily shaped SOL plasmas and antenna to the TORIC core ICRF solver, which was previously demonstrated in the 2D geometry [S. Shiraiwa, et. al., ``HISTORIC: extending core ICRF wave simulation to include realistic SOL plasmas'', Nucl. Fusion in press], to larger and more complicated simulations by including a 3D realistic antenna and integrating RF rectified sheath potential model. Such an extension requires a scalable high fidelity 3D edge plasma wave simulation. We used the MFEM [http://mfem.org], open source scalable C++ finite element method library, and developed a Python wrapper for MFEM (PyMFEM), and then a radio frequency (RF) wave physics module in Python. This approach allows for building a physics layer rapidly, while separating the physics implementation being apart from the numerical FEM implementation. An interactive modeling interface was built on {$\pi$}Scope [S Shiraiwa, et. al. Fusion Eng. Des. 112, 835] to work with an RF simulation model in a complicated geometry.},

  abstract = {The WEST ICRH system has to deal with two challenging issues that no other ICRH system before ITER has faced simultaneously so far, i.e. ELMs resilience and Continuous Wave (CW) RF operation. The technical solution chosen to meet the requests imposed by the WEST scenarios is to build three new launchers based on the RF structure successfully tested in short pulses in 2007 on Tore Supra prototype launcher. This paper gives an overview of the mechanical structure of the CW ELMs resilient WEST ICRH launchers. The technical solutions chosen to drive the mechanical design are presented, in regard of the past experience on the 2007 TS prototype, together with the significant work carried out on the mechanical design to improve the launcher structure. The thermal and electro-mechanical analyses conducted and their impact on the launcher design are also presented. These three new CW ELMs resilient ICRH launchers are foreseen to be installed on WEST in 2016, and operational for the first plasmas.},

  abstract = {Lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) is an attractive option for non-inductive tokamak operation due to its high current drive efficiency and ability to drive current off axis. The parameters of the Alcator C-Mod LHCD system (f0 = 4.6 GHz, B{$\varphi$} 5.5 T, n\textasciimacron{}e 1020 m-3) are similar to the proposed LHCD system on ITER. This paper will describe improvements in LHCD technology on C-Mod designed to increase single-pass absorption at high n\textasciimacron{}e, extend pulse length (to {$>$}3 s), and increase power delivered to the plasma (to {$\sim$}2 MW). Modelling of lower hybrid (LH) wave propagation indicates that the observed loss of LHCD efficiency at higher n\textasciimacron{}e can be mitigated by enhancing the single pass power absorption through use of an off mid-plane launcher. The four rows of the launcher are located above the mid-plane (with Ip and B{$\varphi$} both clockwise viewing from the top down) in order to exploit the poloidal upshift of n as rays propagate from the antenna into the plasma. The transmitter protection system (TPS) was redesigned to model the coolant temperature in real time and shut off the klystron beam voltage if the coolant is close to boiling. The TPS upgrade has been installed and operated on C-Mod for pulses up to 4.5 s into dummy loads and 1.0 s into the plasma. A new movable local LH launcher protection limiter was designed to reduce reflection coefficients across a wide range of launcher positions. Finally, a high power waveguide double-stub tuner is under development to provide feedback controlled load matching to reduce power reflected from the antenna under poor coupling conditions.},

  abstract = {A new technique for the calculation of RF waves in toroidal geometry enables the simultaneous incorporation of antenna geometry, plasma facing components (PFCs), the scrape off-layer (SOL) and core propagation [Shiraiwa et al, ``HIS-TORIC: Extending core ICRF wave simulation to include realistic SOL plasmas'', Nucl. Fusion in press 10 (2017)]. The calculation of antenna coupling has been traditionally performed separately from those of core propagation whereas this method allows them to be combined permitting the modelling of such phenomena as waves reflected from plasma-vacuum boundary or cyclotron resonances back to the antenna. Calculations with this technique also naturally capture wave propagation in the SOL and its interactions with non-conforming PFCs permitting self-consistent calculation of core absorption and edge power loss.},
