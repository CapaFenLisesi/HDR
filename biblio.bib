abstract = {The material presented in the book is built on a substrate of knowledge already provided by the basic sciences of mathematics and physics. Students are supposed to be acquainted with certain topics, such as linear algebra, differential equations, integral calculus, vector analysis and complex functions. If students still have difficulties with these topics, they may have to recap them in order to refresh their skills. This book is not a treatise on electricity and magnetism â€“ its scope is far less ambitious. Its content can be delivered in a single-semester course, and is aimed to provide a scientifically founded and unified basis of fundamental knowledge on electromagnetic field phenomena that will help students follow up more advanced subjects covered in their courses. Topics are introduced in a systematic and friendly manner, proceeding from the simpler to more difficult ones, using a slow build-up process. In addition, a series of application examples and homework problems have been prepared to help students through the learning process. The fact that the book is partitioned into chapters does not imply that some of them can be skipped. Because the subject matter is deeply interrelated, students must try to adhere to the normal chapter sequence, otherwise they may be wasting their time or fail to get an integrated comprehensive view of the electromagnetic phenomena.},
