The purpose of RF engineering for plasma heating and current drive is to transmit several MW of RF power at frequencies from the MHz to GHz range and to deliver it into the plasma with the highest net efficiency as possible. The RF power is generated by one or few RF generators, then eventually combined and transported to the antennas. In order to optimize the global efficiency, it is desirable to have low loss, high electrical efficiency, low reflections, high reliability and actuators to adjust amplitude and phase. 

This chapter review the work done by the author on high power RF devices at CEA/IRFM. The Section~\ref{sec:ICRH_antennas} and \ref{sec:LHCD_antennas} review the work performed on ICRH and LHCD antennas for Tore Supra/WEST and ITER. Because it is needed to bring the power up to the antenna, high power transmission line elements are also necessary. Work performed on the design and tests of few kinds of high power devices such as a mode converter, vacuum windows or RF contacts is detailed in Section~\ref{sec:RF_components}. Since RF breakdowns are a recurrent problematic in high RF power applications, the section~\ref{sec:Multipactor} is fully dedicated to this topic, in particular to the multipactor phenomenon which occurs in vacuum environments and led to collaboration between CNES, ONERA and CEA since 2014.

\subsubsection{Coupling Elements}
In order to excite the Fast-Waves in the Ion Cyclotron range of frequencies ($f=$30-80~MHz) as required for plasma heating, the wave electric field needs to be perpendicular to both $\Bbf_0$ and $\mathbf{k}$. In this rang of frequencies, the wavelength of the electromagnetic waves is of order of few meters, so larger or of the same order as the machine size. To excite the Fast-Wave, ICRH antennas usually consist in array of loop radiators similar to strip-lines, or \textit{straps}, to excite waves directly inside the vacuum vessel (Figure~\ref{fig:icrhantennasimplified}). These straps are oriented perpendicularly to the direction of the magnetic field $B_0$\footnote{In tokamaks, the total magnetic field being slightly tilted with respect to the toroidal direction, straps should have a complex shape to produce fields with the proper polarization. While possible and more accessible nowadays than before with modern manufacturing techniques, building such straps is complex and most antennas use strap oriented in the poloidal direction, i.e. perpendicular to the toroidal magnetic field.}. The antenna geometry and the amplitude and phase distribution of the flowing RF currents $J_{RF}$ on these straps shapes the wavenumber spectrum $E_{RF}(k)$ excited by the antenna. The antenna having a characteristic toroidal size (of tens of centimetres) much smaller than the wave wavelength, most plane waves excited by the antenna are evanescent. The distance to the plasma is thus a crucial parameter for the coupling performances, so antennas are generally made conform as possible to the plasma to minimize the distance from the strap to the plasma.

\subsubsection{Faraday Screen}

	\label{fig:icrhfaradayscreenprinciple}
\end{marginfigure}

Unfortunately, it was identified early that coupling structures do not excite only Fast-Waves but also Slow-Waves \sidecite{evrard1982-1}. Slow-Waves are produced by RF currents parallel to the magnetic field as well by oscillating space charges on the antenna structure. For this reason, early ICRH experiments introduced the use of electrostatic shield, or \textit{Faraday Screen} \sidecite{england1989}. A Faraday Screen is formed by an array of metallic strips (or bars), aligned with the total magnetic field \sidecite{bures1990}. By screening the electric field components parallel to the strips/bars (Figure~\ref{fig:icrhfaradayscreenprinciple}), it aims acting as a polarizer, to filter out specifically the undesirable Slow-Wave. A denser screen better isolates the central conductor of the antenna from the plasma, but it also causes significant magnetic shielding and enhanced Ohmic losses in the screen \sidecite{faulconer1983}, leading to actively cooled structures. Various experiments have shown the benefits of faraday Screen \sidecite{noterdaeme1986, bures1990, myra1990}, but some also concluded that heating performance of unshielded antenna was found to be similar to that of a shielded antenna \sidecite{nieuwenhove1991, nieuwenhove1992}.  Although it might be necessary to keep a Faraday shield for other reasons, such as decoupling of thermal and mechanical stresses on plasma facing components, the question of the necessity of a Faraday Screen in future ICRH antennas is still an open question in the ICRH community \sidecite{noterdaeme2019}.

\subsubsection{Matching}\label{sec:ICRH_matching_systems}
From the RF engineer point of view, an ICRH system is equivalent to transmission line loaded with a complex impedance (Figure~\ref{fig:icrhantennacircuitmodel}). The antenna can be view as an impedance which properties depend on the plasma. 

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/chap3/ICRH_antenna_circuit_model}
	\caption{Simplified model of a ICRH system.}
	\label{fig:icrhantennacircuitmodel}
\end{figure}

A single strap element can be modelled by a line terminated with a lumped impedance $Z_L = R + j X$ \sidecite{bhatnagar1982}. Without plasma, the resistive part of this load represents the antenna Ohmic losses, which are generally small ($R \propto 10^{-1}~\si{\Omega}$. In front of a magnetized plasma, part of the waves are coupled to the plasma and the resistive part of the load increases. Hence, for the circuit point of view, coupling is indistinguishable from increasing losses. In most tokamak experiments, the resistive loading is in the 0.5 to 10 $\si{\Omega}$ range \sidecite{pinsker1998}. The reactive part is mostly inductive. Its value depends mainly of the strap and antenna geometry is generally much higher than the resistive part. In addition, changes of the resistive part are also correlated with changes in the reactive part \cite{pinsker1998}\sidenote{The electrical equivalent length of the antenna is then usually reduced when facing a plasma.}. Since the characteristic impedance of the transmission line $Z_0$ is usually between 30 to 50~$\si{\Omega}$, we always have $R \ll Z_0$ and hence a matching unit is necessary to maximize the power coupled to the plasma by the antenna.

Moreover, sudden changes in antenna loading arise in tokamaks operating in H-mode. During plasma perturbations (such like ELMs), loading rises on a time scale of ~100~ms and subsequently decays on a time scale of a few milliseconds. This sub-millisecond timescale represents a challenge to any dynamic impedance matching scheme implemented in ICRH systems\sidecite{hofmeister1994, ladurelle1997, evrard2005, noterdaeme2005, prechtl2009, grine2012, lin2015}, because their response time is not fast enough. To cope with these fast events, inherently load insensitive schemes, or \textit{load-resilient}, are desirable. At ASDEX-Upgrade, the load resilient system used to maintain the RF power during H-mode is exclusively the 3dB hybrid coupler system. The reflected power is mainly redirected toward a dummy load thanks to the symmetrical properties of the 3dB coupler. At JET, three different load resilient systems are employed. Firstly, a hybrid system feeds antennas A and B. Secondly, a conjugated-T system (resilient antenna) with internal matching is plugged to the ITER-Like Antenna (ILA). Part of the matching is made by vacuum capacitors connected close to the antenna. Thirdly, a conjugated T system with external matching feeds antennas C and D. Part of the matching is made by phase shifters connected far from the antennas.

\subsubsection{RF Sheaths}
Early ICRH experiments have reported non-linear interactions between high power RF waves and edge plasma, leading to the production of influx of impurities which prevented efficient heating of the plasma \sidecite{rothman1966}. Since then, despite improvements in antenna design and plasma operation which substantially reduced these undesirable phenomenon \sidecite{noterdaeme1993}, it still remains an important operational limitation of ICRH \sidecite{noterdaeme2019-1}. One mechanism leading to the release impurities during ICRH operation is RF sheaths rectification. 

Because of their mass difference, there is a discrepancy between ions and electrons motions along magnetic field lines. Electrons accumulate faster than ions on Plasma Facing Components (PFC) and form a thin negatively biased layer that repulses electrons and attracts ions. This attraction increases the ion parallel energy into the wall and thus enhance the heavy ion bombardment of the PFC. Ion impacting the PFC can cause sputtering of impurities that can reach and contaminate the plasma. In the presence RF waves parallel to the magnetic field lines (which corresponds to the Slow-Wave polarization) driven by ICRH antenna, sheaths are enhanced. Instead of being constant in time, DC potential drop across the sheath is then the superposition of a DC component and a RF oscillations, called \textit{RF-induced sheath rectification}. This  mechanism has been identified as a major reason for the increased interaction with the wall as is still an intense research topic \sidecite{bobkov2019}.

\subsection{WEST ICRH Antennas Design}
\marginnote{Parts of this section are taken from \citeauthyear{hillairet2015-2} and CEA/IRFM internal reports made in 2013-2014 during the design of the WEST ICRH antennas.}

\subsubsection{Context}
Three new identical ELM-resilient and CW power ICRH antennas have been designed for WEST. The ELM resilience property is obtained through an internal conjugate-T electrical scheme with series capacitors\sidecite{bosia2003-1}. The antenna design is based on a previously tested prototype in 2004 and 2007 at 48~MHz \sidecite{vulliez2008, argouarch2009}, illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:proto2007antenna}. 

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{figures/chap3/WEST_ICRH/proto2007_antenna}
	\caption{CAD model of the "2007 Prototype" antenna.}
	\label{fig:proto2007antenna}
\end{figure}

In the frame of the Associated Laboratory in the fusion field between IRFM and ASIPP, the 2007 design has been upgraded for WEST in order to: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item improve the power capabilities and coupling resistance from the previous prototype   \sidecite{helou2015-1}
	\item increase the nominal frequency range to 55~MHz to match WEST scenarios\sidecite{bourdelle2015}
	\item allow CW operation with actively cooled components \sidecite{chen2015, vulliez2015}.
\end{itemize} 

The 2020 panorama of worldwide ICRH system operational domains is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:westicrhcomparaisonothermachines}. The next ICRH system under realization is the one of ITER, which combines both high power and high durations.

	\caption{2020 panorama of main ICRH system operational domains (independently of plasma conditions)}
	\label{fig:westicrhcomparaisonothermachines}
\end{figure}

All the aspects previously listed led to iterate between RF and mechanical design, with generally opposite constraints and necessary compromises\sidenote{In order to improve the mechanical assembly of the WEST antenna in comparison to the 2007 prototype, the main dimensions changes have been proposed by K.Vulliez, A.Argouarch and P.Mollard for the conceptual design review in 2013 and assessed after from the RF point of view in an internal note\sidecite{hillairet2014-1}}. While the ICRH system upgrade for the WEST project also concerned the generator update and the moving of an antenna from port Q5 to port Q4A, this section only focuses on the antenna design.

	\label{fig:proto2007antennacut}
\end{figure}


% ###################################################
\subsubsection{Front Parts}
With respect to the 2007 prototype, the front face of the WEST ICRH antennas have undergone few major changes in order to meet the following objectives:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Increase the antenna overall coupling resistance $R_c$ (Eq.(\ref{eq:coupling_resistance}))
	\item Increase the nominal antenna frequency to 55~MHz
	\item Water-cool the whole antenna, in particular the straps, the antenna box and the Faraday screen
	\item Minimize sheaths potential
\end{enumerate}

Increasing the coupling resistance allows coupling more power for a given set of voltages and currents. In other words, it also allows lowering capacitor voltages (and electric field) and currents for a given coupled power, which has operational and safety benefits\sidenote{In addition, the capacitor manufacturer COMET has lowered the maximum voltage and current specifications on its products between 2004 and 2013. Meeting lower voltage and current specifications.}. 

The frequency increase is a practical consequence of the changes of Tore Supra to become WEST\sidecite{bourdelle2015}: as the plasma volume was reduced and  shifted toward the high field side of the machine, locating the cyclotron resonance in the plasma centre requires higher RF frequencies (cf. Eq.(\ref{eq:cyclotron_resonance})). The desired frequency band of the ICRH system for WEST was thus asked to 48-60~MHz \todo{WEST ICRH guide}

\begin{marginfigure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/chap3/WEST_ICRH/WEST_front_face_evolution1}
	\caption{Evolution of 2D CAD models for coupling optimization.}
	\label{fig:westfrontfaceevolution1}
\end{marginfigure}

From July 2013 to May 2014, the coupling of various models have been assessed using the COMSOL finite element software. Perfectly Match Layers (PMLs) boundary conditions adapted to plasma fast wave were used in 2D and 3D\sidecite{jacquot2013, colas2019}. Starting from the 2007 prototype geometry, the effects of geometrical modifications on coupling resistance have been assessed, from very simplified parametrized 2D (Figure~\ref{fig:westfrontfaceevolution1}) to almost final 3D geometries (Figure~\ref{fig:westfrontfaceevolution2}). These models used first experimental density profiles obtained in Tore Supra in 2007 (pulse \#40574) before using assumptions of WEST density profiles. In this pulse, an L-mode plasma has been moved horizontally over 5 cm in front of the load-resilient antenna prototype to assess its coupling properties at 48 MHz. The calculations have been performed for 8 profiles in order to make relative comparisons of the coupling resistance. 2D model run in few minutes while 3D models typically required ten to twenty hours depending on their complexity and the distance to the cut-off density on a desktop computer. 

These parametrized models allowed us to assess the relevant geometrical parameters (strap thickness, width, and distances to the plasma cut-off and antenna box) affecting the coupling resistance. In order to optimize the coupling resistance in dipole configuration, the thickness of the strap has been kept as low as possible (between 13 and 15 mm) while ensuring sufficient stiffness, since they are water cooled through 70$\si{\degreeCelsius}$/30~bars inner channels. As an example, at 57~MHz, increasing the strap thickness by 15~mm decreased the coupling resistance by 25\% for the same plasma loading. The coupling resistance of the new antennas has been increased compared to the prototypes one in particular by reducing the distance between the strap and the Faraday screen bars from 52~mm to 34~mm and by supressing a vertical septum which was masking a portion of the straps in the prototype (Figure~\ref{fig:westfrontfaceevolution1}). 

\begin{marginfigure}

	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/chap3/WEST_ICRH/WEST_front_face_evolution2}
	\caption{Evolution of 3D CAD models for coupling optimization.}
	\label{fig:westfrontfaceevolution2}
\end{marginfigure}

Each antenna is equipped with four internal COMET tunable vacuum capacitors, with capacitances ranging from 15~pF to 150~pF and specifically upgraded for CW operation. In order to operate the antenna at a higher frequency, 55~MHz compared with the 48~MHz of the prototype, with the same capacitance range, the straps electrical length has been reduced in order to decrease their reactance $X_s$. However, increasing the coupling resistance also decreases the strap reactance $X_s$ {\sidecite{pinsker1998, helou2018}. Hence, trade-off were unavoidable between coupling efficiency and impedance matching as the desired frequencies\footnote{Other trade-off have been made due to the following reasons. Bringing closer the strap and its feeder leads to reduce the coupling resistance (-23\% decrease of the coupling resistance for 50~mm distance reduction). Increasing the toroidal width of the straps led to reduce the strap reactance but also to decrease the coupling resistance (-50\% decrease of the coupling resistance for +40~mm width increase). It has been kept to 130~mm, the same value as for the prototype.}. 

As the design of the antenna progressed, the coupling of few milestone CAD 3D models has been calculated with the TOPICA code \sidecite{milanesio2009} with the same plasma scenarios to assess the impact of mechanical design evolutions on the coupling performances.



RF circuit optimizations have been first conducted on a single conjugate-T with uncoupled straps loaded with impedances. Thereafter, full-wave models of the T-junction, impedance transformer and vacuum feedthrough have been taken into account in ANSYS Designer®. This allows pushing realistic RF excitations into the full-wave ANSYS HFSS® model in order to deduce the heat flux topologies over the devices, which then can be easily imported in ANSYS Mechanical® for thermal modelling. Capacitors have been modelled using equivalent circuits. Finally, an electric circuit of the full antenna using TOPICA impedance matrices has been simulated. This model has been used to deduce the realistic capacitor sets, current and voltage values to be expected for various plasma scenarios. A full-wave modelling of the capacitor has also been performed and integrated into a RF circuit solver to confirm the approach [11].

Expected electron density profiles for WEST H-mode plasmas have also been used to load the antenna model. A set of profiles have been calculated for 3 different line average densities. Since the plasma volume in WEST is smaller than in Tore Supra, the antennas are located closer to the centre of the machine to keep the same gap from the antenna to the plasma. Three radial locations of the antenna have been used (R=3, 2.975 and 2.95 m) to model the coupling in TOPICA with these profiles, with the toroidal curvature of the plasma adjusted accordingly to the WEST magnetic ripple. As no data were available for H-mode temperature profile, L-mode profile has been used. It has to be noted than the private plasma located between the antenna limiters has not been included in the TOPICA models.

Using the coupling resistance definition from ref. [6] and the maximum capacitors currents and voltages (850 A and 54 kV peak respectively) the maximum coupled power has been calculated. In order to balance the top and bottom strap current magnitudes, one can allow the launchers input impedances to have an additional imaginary part. It might increase the VSWR but still allowing higher coupled power: an unbalanced current distribution can lead to currents/voltages exceeding the maximum limits at one strap while they are by far respecting the limits for the other one. FIGURE1 illustrates the maximum coupled power achievable for the three antennas with respect to capacitors current and voltage limitations, for two matching strategies (VSWR=1:1 or VSWR<1.7:1). In this curve, the antennas have been matched for each coupling resistance point.

	\label{fig:bridgeevolution}
\end{marginfigure}

In order to reduce the manufacturing cost as well to simplify the mechanical assembly design of the bridge, it has been proposed to design the bridge symmetrical with respect to its input transmission line. An idealized bridge/antenna box geometry which dimensions corresponding to the 2007 Prototype has been created and compared to one with an in-axis input transmission line (Figure~\ref{fig:bridgeevolution}). As minor changes were observed on both reflection and transmission, the WEST ICRH antenna bridges has been made symmetrical with respect to the input transmission line.

	\caption{Illustration of the bridge/antenna box inner dimensions $d_1$, $d_2$ and $d_3$.}
	\label{fig:bridgeevolution2}
\end{marginfigure}

Also in order to facilitate the mechanical assembly of the antenna, in particular the water pipes and diagnostic cables connection, it has been proposed to enlarge the distance between the rear part of the antenna box and the rear part of the bridge, ie. the dimensions $d_1$, $d_2$ and $d_3$ are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:bridgeevolution2}. The influence of each dimensions on RF performances have been assessed and it was proposed to keep the 2007 prototype ($d_1$=17.7~mm) value for the WEST antenna and not increasing it (keeping this value to the minimum possible from a mechanical point of view). The $d_2$ dimension could be increased by 20~mm from the 2007 prototype ($d_2$=30.8~mm) value for the WEST antenna ($d_2\to$50~mm). Increasing the length $d_3$ means increasing the strap electrical length. A +20~m ($d_3\to$30~mm.) increasing as been proposed, which impacts the matching capability of the antenna, especially for higher frequencies (50-60MHz). However, 

For the same reason, the radial length of the bridge labelled $L_3$ in Figure~\ref{fig:bridgeevolution3} has been increase by 50~mm ($L_3\to $185.5~mm) for the WEST antenna. The $L_3$ length was found to has no impact on the VSWR of the antenna. Thus, the radial length of the bridge has been increased by50~mm ($L_3\to$185.5~mm) for the WEST antenna.

A two-stage quarter-wavelength and water cooled impedance transformer is connected from the bridge to the vacuum feed-through. The impedance transformer dimensions have been optimized for a 3~$\si{\Omega}$ T-junction impedance and a 30~$\si{\Omega}$ feeder characteristic impedance at 50~MHz. The final diameters have been afterwards adjusted to match pipe diameter standards with a slight compromise with the RF performance.

\subsection{WEST ICRH Antenna Modelling}\label{sec:WEST_ICRH_antenna_modelling}
\marginnote{Parts of this section are taken from \citeauthyear{hillairet2019-1}}
In this section, we illustrate the complete RF modelling the WEST Ion Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ICRH) antenna. The complete antenna circuit is made by connecting the various elements that compose it, separately full-wave modelled from the final CAD model of the antenna or using equivalent lumped models. 

Such approach is not new \textit{per se} since it was done during the WEST ICRH antenna design with commercial software such as ANSYS Designer in \sidecite{hillairet2015-2} and was also done with proprietary codes (i.e. owned by the person or the firm who has developed it) in \sidecite{durodie2015, helou2015-2}. However, the author firmly believes in the advantages Open Source software in Science, as when these tools are not open-sourced, it leads to an obvious reproducibility problem as one should only rely on authors claims. To conform to the necessity of reproducibility in science,  software sources used in physical and engineering researches should ideally be made open when possible \sidecite{ince2012}. The case of RF network manipulation and analysis is no different. Thus, this section illustrates some functionalities of the open source Python package \texttt{scikit-rf} co-developed by the author and used by hundred (thousands?) of users in the world\marginnote{At the time of the writing of this manuscript (April 2020), the \texttt{scikit-rf} package has been download more then 50000 times since January 2017 using the Anaconda Python package manager (but this include multiple downloads/user). The number of download of the package on github is of the order of 20 to 50 per 15 days. The mailing list has 124 registered users.}.

}

\end{marginfigure}

The three WEST ICRH antennas are load tolerant resonant structures equipped with internal vacuum matching capacitors (Figure~\ref{fig:cometcapacitor}). These capacitors are tuned before the antenna operation or are real-time controlled to maintain low reflected power toward the RF sources \sidecite[+5cm]{hillairet2015, helou2015-2}. In order to forge a relevant numerical model of the antenna, it is thus needed to modify the capacitance of these matching capacitors. At least two approaches can be used: (i) using an equivalent lumped model of the capacitor or (ii) interpolating the capacitor S-parameters from full-wave simulations (if available). The challenge with the former is to use a relevant model to capture the RF behaviour of the capacitor in its operational environment, where parasitic capacitances/inductances may arise from surrounding elements and are mostly unknown. The main difficulty with the later is to design a full-wave parametrized model geometrically accurate, assuming dimensions and materials of the capacitor are known. Both approaches can be implemented with \texttt{scikit-rf} as the package is able to compute S-parameters of RF circuits made from ideal lumped elements (resistor/capacitor/inductor, in series/shunt configuration)  or to interpolate between N-port networks with same frequencies \footnote{Similar to the \texttt{NPort\_Multi} component in ANSYS Designer}. In the example below, both approaches are mixed: the capacitor (from COMET), which has been previously simulated with ANSYS HFSS for few different capacitance configurations during the PhD work of W.Helou \sidecite{helou2018}, is used to extract the lumped element parameters. Once fitted to an equivalent model, the capacitor networks can be driven as a function of their capacitances, while S-parameter interpolation only depend on of geometrical parameter (like the distance between capacitor electrodes).

A N-port electrical network is described in \texttt{scikit-rf} with the \texttt{Network} object, defined from its network parameters (S, Z, Y-parameters), port characteristic impedances and frequency information. It can be created from a file or directly from data. Importing all the touchstone files located in directory into a collection of \texttt{Network} in a \texttt{NetworkSet} object and plotting the real part of the $S_{21}$ parameter for each network for a subset of the frequency range is straightforward\footnote{Code snippets are complete minimal example but does not necessary reproduce all figure details such as line styles, markers or labels. Readers should refer to associated \href{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2668370}{online notebooks }for the full code listing.}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
import skrf as rf
# Read all the Touchstone file from a directory
capas_set = rf.NetworkSet.from_dir('S_Matrices/Capacitors')
# plot all S21 values for a given frequency band
# (Indexing starts at 0 in Python)
capas_set['20-80 MHz'].plot_s_re(m=1, n=0)
\end{lstlisting}

Assuming the \texttt{NetworkSet} contains $M$ networks coming from a parameter sweep of $M$ values described in a \texttt{param\_values} array, creating an interpolated network for a new value is achieved with:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
ntw = capas_set.interpolate_from_network(param_values, new_value)\end{lstlisting}

Figure~\ref{fig:capassets21db} illustrates the interpolation of $S_{21}$ at a given frequency for intermediate values of the swept parameter, here related to the distance between capacitor electrodes (noted $D_{cylinders}$). Obviously, the interpolation precision increases with the number of networks in the set.

\end{marginfigure}

However, in the case of the WEST ICRH antenna, the capacitor is inserted inside the antenna and is surrounded by the outer conductor elements, creating additional stray capacitances and inductances. In this situation, its turns out that the equivalent capacitance of the setup is modified \cite{helou2018}. The RF capacitance can nevertheless be extracted from full-wave calculation using a refined equivalent lumped model with additional shunt capacitances and R-L elements around the capacitor itself to model the proximity of the outer conductor housing and propagation effects\sidenote{The parallel resistor $R_p$ can be neglected in the tens of MHz frequency range considered here.} (Figure~\ref{fig:capacitor_equivalent_circuit_WEST}). Such electrical network can be constructed with \texttt{scikit-rf} with the following function:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
# here we neglect the parallel resistance R_p
freq = rf.Frequency(start=5, stop=95, npoints=101, unit='MHz')
# line is an ideal transmission line media
l = rf.media.DefinedGammaZ0(frequency=freq, z0=50)  
# ** is the scikit-rf network cascading operator
pre  = l.resistor(R1)**l.inductor(L1)**l.shunt_capacitor(C1)
post = l.shunt_capacitor(C1)**l.resistor(R1)**l.inductor(L1)
capa = l.resistor(R)**l.inductor(L)**l.capacitor(C)
capa_WEST = pre ** cap ** post  
\end{lstlisting}

Using the standard optimization toolbox shipped in the \href{https://www.scipy.org/}{\texttt{scipy}} package, the model parameters can be fitted for each full-wave network. Once done, full-wave references and lumped model can be compared. The Figure~\ref{fig:capacitor_interpolation} shows the calculated $S_{21}$ parameter which fit nice with the reference full-wave values. For most capacitance configurations, the error is below -40~dB. Taking constant lumped parameters ($R_s, L_s, C_1=C_2, R_1=R_2, L_1=L_2$) but $C$, the still matches well the full-wave reference except for the lowest range of capacitance values, in a region where the relationship between the electrodes distance and the capacitance is no more linear. The model can thus be used to determine a realistic relationship between the RF capacitance and the capacitor configuration (driven by motors).

\subsubsection{Antenna RF Circuit}
In \texttt{scikit-rf}, there is at least two ways of building a RF circuit made of various networks. The first method consists in connecting networks one by one using \texttt{Network} methods. A second method consists in defining all the connections between networks and ports at once time, then use the \texttt{Circuit} object to build the resultant network. While the later method can be more verbose than the former, it has some advantages when the circuit has many connections. \texttt{Circuit} uses a systematic solving method giving both internal (for each circuit connections) and external (for ports) S-parameters for an arbitrary number of networks and interconnections and independently of the circuit excitation \sidecite{hallbjorner2003}. By imposing excitations at ports, it allows obtaining voltages/currents inside the circuit.

The Figure~\ref{fig:antenna_circuit} schematizes a half WEST ICRH antenna, where the impedances connected to the capacitors model the antenna loading. The associated \texttt{Circuit} is built from the code example given below. In this example, each network has been previously imported or created.

The Figure~\ref{fig:halfantennacurrentvoltage} illustrates the voltage and current at the capacitors, extracted from the circuit for a specified excitation. The full antenna, which consists in two adjacent similar circuits can be built similarly. \texttt{Circuit} allows visualizing the circuit graph using the \href{https://networkx.github.io/}{\texttt{networkx}} package \sidecite{hagberg2008}, which is useful to check that the intended circuit is the one expected (such as connections, port numbers and characteristic impedances).

\end{figure}

During the WEST C3 campaign in 2017-2018, the first two ICRH antennas have been commissioned and used on plasma \sidecite{helou2019}, after having been separately commissioned at high voltage under vacuum on the TITAN test bed \sidecite{bernard2019}. Up to 1~MW per antenna have been achieved and up to 1.4~MW with the two antennas combined. Antennas behaved as expected from RF modelling and their tuning have been made both manually and using a real-time controlled algorithm. 

During the WEST experimental campaign C4 in 2019 and for the first time in WEST, all the three ICRH antennas have been operated on plasma. The RF plant has been run reliably and all three antennas have been used simultaneously on plasma. Using ICRH system alone, the total RF coupled power on plasma peaked to 6~MW and reached regularly the range of 3~MW during few seconds. The ICRH system has been operated together with the Lower Hybrid and Current Drive (LHCD) system: up to 9.2~MW peak and 8~MW during 3 seconds in stable conditions of combined RF power have coupled.

Long pulse high power operation requires dedicated protections from the generator to the antenna. Several complementary interlock systems have been also validated \cite{helou2019}. Sub-Harmonic Arc Detector (SHAD) and reflected power interlocks stop generators from feeding an antenna within 10~µs, then re-apply power after 30~ms. The RF power is real-time controlled in order not to exceed the antenna maximum electric field (2~kV/mm) or the maximum voltages and currents thresholds at the capacitors (30~kV or 915~A peak values respectively). The new optical arc detectors looking inside the antenna have been qualified and found to trigger mostly during the conditioning phases. These optical detectors are particularly essential to protect the low impedance sections of the antenna, where arcs may not trigger other safety systems. The pressure level inside the antenna is monitored from an auxiliary pumping system.  RF power is cut if pressure is above a safety threshold of $3.5\times10^{-3}$~Pa until pressure recovers. Abnormal events can also be detected from the antenna voltage measurements and additional interlocks have been added for safer operation. RF power is stopped within 10~µs in case of voltages lower than 10~kV (for power larger than 100 kW) or if voltages relative differences are higher than 50\%. Thanks to all of these security systems no damage has been observed on the three antenna front-faces after the WEST 2019 experimental campaign.

\subsection{Summary of this section}
In 2013-2014, the RF design of the WEST ICRH antenna has been performed at CEA/IRFM. The design started from the dimensions of an antenna prototype tested on Tore Supra in 2004 and 2007. The dimensions of the antenna front face have been optimized using the COMSOL software in order to improve the antenna coupling with respect to the 2007 prototype. Other elements of the antenna have been optimized to leave more space for water cooled elements since the WEST antenna is fully water-cooled in order to be compatible with CW operation. 

The complete RF model of the WEST ICRH antennas has been modelled using the open-source Python package \href{http://scikit-rf.org/}{\texttt{scikit-rf}}, which the author is co-developer. The package provides a modern, object-oriented library for network analysis and calibration which is both flexible and scalable. The WEST ICRH antenna is modelled by connecting the various elements that compose it, separately full-wave modelled from final CAD models. Tunable elements, such as the matching capacitors, can be either created from ideal lump components or from interpolating full-wave calculations performed at various capacitance configurations. Being open-source, using \texttt{scikit-rf} to create the antenna numerical model with reproducible work-flow adds confidence in the fact that future users could use/maintain and extend it.

Finally, the three WEST ICRH antenna have been commissioned and used on WEST plasma between 2017 and 2019. The commissioning phase was relatively short, of about two days for each antenna to reach 1 to 1.5¨~MW. In the C4 campaign, after this commissioning phase, all three antennas have been operated simultaneously on WEST plasmas, leading to 5.8~MW coupled ICRH power after around 50~plasma discharges (close to 2~MW per antenna). All antennas are equipped with dedicated gas puffing valves in order to improve the coupling conditions. However, due to the present WEST pumping system capabilities, no major coupling improvement has been observed for the limited level of gas flux injected by these valves so far. In combined operation with the Lower Hybrid Current Drive (LHCD) system, a total injected RF power of up to 9.2~MW has been achieved. These first results give confidence in achieving higher performances in future WEST plasma.

\subsubsection{“Grill” Antennas}
\todo{Power limit and multipactor in grill:\cite{hwang1981, vaughan1982, goniche2012-2, goniche2014} from vaughan1982:
	This suggests that multipactor in the Brambilla grill might be suppressed
	by making each of the dividing septa thicker in the middle than at the
	edges, to introduce a similar small lateral component of RF field. If
	successful, this would have the merit of being a "geometrical" not
	subject to change during the life of the equipment. Solutions to multipactor
	which depend on surface treatment orc onditioning are inherently
	less reliable, because further surface changes during life are not only
	possible but very probable.
	If tests are made of this suggestion, it is essential that the actual working
	environment be reproduced, most particularly the local magnetic
	field. Multipactor is a phenomenon strongly influenced by stray fields,
	and testsi n which they are norte presented are almost valueless.

\todo{If the window is located far from the plasma, then the electron cyclotron resonance layer can fall in the vacuum section of the guide. this condition can lead to breakdown.}



As the plasma cross-section dimensions of toroidal devices became sufficiently large to accommodate the free space wavelength at the lower hybrid frequencies, it becomes possible to couple the RF power directly by open-ended waveguides inserted in the vacuum vessel wall, thus avoiding coils or antennas within the vacuum chamber\footnote{To give some numerical orders, the COMPASS-D tokamak, operated in Culham from to 1989 to 2001, used 1.3 GHz RF power sources, and rectangular waveguides of cross-section 165x82mm to carry the RF power to the LH launcher. Smaller wavelengths (i.e. higher frequency sources, up to 8 GHz) have been used, leading to smaller waveguides cross-section.}.

However, in order for the wave to access from outside the plasma to inside the plasma, the wave has to be “slowed down” along the static toroidal magnetic field. This means that the parallel phase velocity of the wave $v_{\parallel}$ has to be reduced with respect to the speed of light $c_0$, in order to being able to penetrate trough the plasma. It is said that the waves must satisfy an \emph{accessibility condition} \sidecite{golant1972, stix1992}\footnote{The accessibility condition is sometime referred as the Golant's accessibility criterion, for e.g. in\sidecite{puri1974}.} Equivalently, this condition requires for the wave to have a sufficiently large refractive \emph{parallel index} $n_{\parallel} = c_0/v_{\parallel} = k_{\parallel}/k_0$, parallel to the magnetic field. The use of a phased array as a way to slow down the waves and thus to launch LH waves was first suggested by Lallia and investigated by Bernabei et al. in 1975\sidecite{bernabei1975}. Lallia suggested that a set of properly phased waveguides, called "grill"\footnote{The similarity to the cooking utensil leads to nickname these launchers "grill".}, would efficiently slow down the wave parallel to toroidal magnetic field. The short sides of the waveguides are mounted parallel to the toroidal magnetic field, to launch effectively a slow wave mode into the plasma. 

The coupling is the process by which RF power propagates and possibly tunnels from an antenna to the plasma \sidecite{Meneghini2012}. Brambilla developed the theory of the coupling of  a simplified grill structure to a large toroidal plasma \sidecite{brambilla1979} \footnote{The Brambilla theory has been applied (and still) to many different geometries, from single waveguide to hundred of waveguides array. Some examples are cited here, like a 2-waveguides array with one mode in \sidecite{krapchev1978} or to 16-waveguides array in \sidecite{stevens1988}.} This coupling theory has been generalized later to the fast wave coupling \sidecite{theilhaber1980} and to 3D rectangular waveguides in \sidecite{Bers1981, bers1983}. 

Several important remarks can be drawn from the properties of the propagation of cold-plasma waves into the plasma. The wave is evanescent if the electron density is below a cut-off density $n_{\mathrm{cutoff}}$. However, if such a low density layer is thin enough, the wave can tunnel through it. Thus, similarly to ICRF antennas, the LH launcher must be close enough of the plasma\footnote{Or the plasma local density must be increased by gas puffing.} in order to efficiently couple high power. 

In these conditions, the thermal and mechanical stresses are essential parameters to design an LH launcher. They and constitute a challenge to deliver such for these systems in for fusion reactors. As for ICRH antennas, LHCD launchers distributed in the vacuum vessel is being proposed for DEMO, mitigating substantially these issues.

Different types of grills have been developed to accommodate the conditions that the wave must be coupled to and (then) propagate in the plasma.

\subsubsection{Multijunction Launchers}\label{sec:multijunction}
In a large tokamak, a conventional LH grill made of independently fed waveguides would require hundred of waveguides, leading to a very complex power splitting design behind the antenna (cf.Figure \ref{fig:cmodlh1}). The use of \emph{multijunction} grill was suggested in 1984 to overcome this limitation \sidecite{gormezano1985}. In a multijunction grill, the main waveguide is divided into $N$ smaller (secondary waveguides) by thin metallic walls parallels to the wall of the main waveguide and perpendicular to the electric field: the \emph{E-plane N-junctions}. Built-in phase shifters made by reducing the waveguide height (in order to increase the guided wave phase velocity) are added in the structure in order to obtain the desired output phasing of the grill. Multijunction launcher makes it simpler to create and feed a large number or waveguides, at the contrary of classic grills launchers. However, a drawback is that the adjustment range of the power density spectrum is limited to a smaller range than for classic grills launchers.

A judicious choice of the phasing of the output waveguides leads to an important self-matching property of the multijunction (also known as \emph{recycling effect} or \emph{load resilience}). Indeed, for specific phase values, the reflected waves from the plasma which return back in the secondary waveguides can be reflected back to the plasma, thus leading to multiple reflections in the secondary waveguides. This recycling effect, which takes place between the plasma-antenna discontinuity and the E-plane bi-junctions, leads to an attenuation of the waves at each passage by the plasma, and ultimately to a decrease of the reflected power toward the RF sources. 

\todo{Illustration of the recycling effect (load resilience) inside a multijunction}.

\subsubsection{Passive-Active waveguide array launchers}
One of the main show-stopper to the use of LHCD to realize long and efficient pulses (outside the constraints of the tokamak magnetic coils heating) is the ability to couple high LH power to the plasma. Indeed, in order to achieve good coupling, the electron density in front of the LH launchers needs to be large enough, which means that the launcher needs to be located close enough to the plasma or to increase the local density by gas puffing means. 

The alternation of \emph{passive} waveguide (a waveguide closed by a short-circuit) and \emph{active} waveguide (a waveguide that is directly fed from the generator) has been initially proposed by Motley and Hooke \sidecite{motley1980} in order to minimize the \emph{surface wave} excitation. Moreover, it was found that adding passive waveguide at each side of the array leads to decrease the reflected power in the last active guide \sidecite{krapchev1978, motley1980}. The passive waveguides act as reflectors, radiating back a part of the power reflected by the plasma, and thus improving the coupling efficiency. Passive-Active grills were envisaged since the 1980' for fusion-reactor grade devices \sidecite{ehst1982}. In these first conceptual designs, the passive waveguides were thought to be plugged or tuned individually in order for the outgoing power to have the requisite phase corresponding to an all-active grill system. 

Being close to the plasma leads to increase the heat fluxes into on the launcher front face. Thus, in order to improve the cooling of the launcher front face, it has been proposed in 1995 to insert one passive waveguide between each active waveguide, behind which a water pipe could efficiently water-cool the structure \sidecite{bibet1995}. 

In order to insure a lower reflected power than a conventional grill, it has been proposed to associate this alternation of passive-active waveguide to  use a multijunction. This Passive-Active Multijunction (PAM) concept addresses two of the main criticisms made to LH launchers, i.e. the coupling efficiency and the heat loads resilience.

\subsubsection{Poloidal splitter launchers}
Motivated by the reduction of the RF losses and the increase of the reliability of a LH launcher, while keeping the flexibility in the parallel index $n_{\parallel}$ spectrum of the “grill” configuration (at the contrary of multijunction), the Alcator C-Mod team developed in 2008 a launcher (LH2) based on a four way splitter \sidecite{koert2009}. At the contrary of multijunction launcher, the four way splitter divides the power in the poloidal direction. Since the power splitting is done poloidally, the launched parallel power spectrum can be changed with the same flexibility as with conventional grill antennas. This design simplified the feeding structure of the antenna, thus reducing the RF losses due to multiple power splitters and flanges of previous grill configurations, while keeping a simple manufacturing assembly. The RF power is redistributed depending on the plasma load on each of the four rows of the splitter. If the load is the same for each row, the power is evenly split among rows. The RF optimization of the launcher has been made for a source frequency of 4.6 GHz and assuming a simplified plasma load (constant) in front of each row. A similar design has been made for the KSTAR tokamak, at 5~GHz \sidecite{kim2012, kim2019}.

\subsubsection{LH Launchers main figures of merit}

There are three important figures of merit to measure the efficiency and the performances of a LH launcher: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The first one is the k-space radiated power spectrum, generally characterized by its \emph{parallel power spectrum} $p(n_{\parallel})$ . This quantity represents the amount of power for each parallel index excited by the launcher. The relation between this power spectrum and the array excitation is related to the Fourier transform of the electromagnetic field at the plasma-antenna interface. 
	
	\item  The second one is the ratio of the reflected power (at the mouth or at the end of the launcher) to the input power, named the \emph{reflection coefficient} (sometime expressed in percent). 
	$$RC = \frac{P_r}{P_f}$$
	\item The third one is the \emph{directivity} of the launcher, which is the fraction of the power spectrum over its total power content. It can be viewed as the fraction of the power that goes toward one toroidal direction over the total coupled power. One can define the directivity as follow\footnote{Other definitions exist, essentially in order to ad a physical content to the directivity, in relation with the current drive efficiency evolution in the plasma. See for instance \sidecite{Litaudon1990a}.}
	$$
	D
	= 
	\frac{
		\int_{n_{\parallel} >0} p(n_{\parallel}) dn_{\parallel} 
	}{
		\int_{n_{\parallel}} p(n_{\parallel}) dn_{\parallel} } 
	$$
\end{enumerate}

Theoretically, if the $n_{\parallel}$ spectrum of an antenna is known, one can evaluate the reflection coefficient. However, since the wave field at the launcher aperture (and thus the launcher spectrum) depends on the plasma itself, numerical codes are required to make a self-consistent numerical evaluation of the coupling. Such codes are coupling codes.

% #####################################################
\subsubsection{LH systems and launchers performances}
Mainly because of its relative simplicity, most of the LH launchers have been based on a "grill" configuration, as for example in the 1980' \sidecite{porkolab1984, gormezano1986, stevens1988}.

Typical grill launchers have a high reflection coefficient (of the order of 20 to 40\%) but directivity higher than 80\%. Since all the waveguides can be feed by independent RF sources, and thus independently phased, such launchers have a wide flexibility in terms of operational space (excited spectrum) which is of great interest for physics studies. However, since each waveguide is independently power fed, the complexity of the launcher grows enormously with the number of output waveguides, leading to cumbersome transmission systems for multi-megawatt power levels (Table \ref{tab:grillperformances}).

Multijunction launchers at the contrary have led to hundred of waveguides launchers (see Table \ref{tab:multijunctionperformances}). The complexity of the multijunction design and manufacturing is balanced by the a simpler transmission line system behind the launcher. Because of the self-matching property, the typical reflection coefficient of multijunction launchers is generally less than 10\%. However, the multiple back and forth of the waves leads to an increase of the peak electric field in secondary waveguides. Moreover, since the phase shift is created by the built-in phase shifter inside the launcher, the flexibility of phase configuration is reduced in comparison to classic grill launchers.

The PAM concept tested in FTU and in the Tore Supra tokamak showed that reflected power lower than 5\% (i.e. high coupling efficiency) and continuous operations could be combined (cf. Figure \ref{fig:ts45472c4ir}) during long pulse operations.

\subsection{ITER LHCD Antenna}\label{sec:ITER_LHCD_antenna}
\marginnote{Part of this section are taken from paper \cite{hillairet2011, hillairet2013}.}
The high current drive efficiency of lower hybrid waves makes Lower Hybrid Current Drive (LHCD) system a crucial actuator to sustain a fraction of the non-inductive current drive in tokamaks. Simulations of ITER scenarios show that LHCD can help saving the poloidal flux consumption during ramp-up phases and thus extends significantly the flat-top duration. Although not part of the initial ITER planned procurement phase, a 20~MW/CW 5~GHz LHCD system was expected to be commissioned and used for the second mission of ITER\sidenote{Since 2008, the LHCD system has been removed from the list of the heating and current drive systems of ITER\cite{iterorganization2018}.}, i.e. Q=5 steady state target. In 2011-2013, as part of an international work leaded by CEA/IRFM, CEA/IRFM made a particular R\&D effort in order to validate the design and the performances of 5~\si{GHz} LHCD system for ITER\sidecite{hoang2009-1}. 

Depending on the plasma scenarios (steady-state, hybrid, ramp-up, etc.), the additional current driven by LHCD would range between 0.42 MA (steady-state) up to more than 3.0~MA (ramp-up) \sidecite{decker2011}. In any case, these values confirm that for steady state scenarios, a substantial bootstrap current is required \sidecite{jacquinot1999}. The average current drive efficiency, which is the figure of merit of the LHCD, has been calculated to be $\eta \equiv 0.2 \times 10^{20} \si{A m^{-2} W^{-1}}$, similar to the ones measured in present days tokamaks \sidecite{jacquinot1999}. This value  can be compared to other additional current drive scheme, such as NBI or ECCD. 

On the technological aspect, the Passive Active Multijunction launcher concept has been validated on FTU\sidecite{pericoli-ridolfini1999} and in steady-state conditions at 3.7~\si{GHz} on Tore Supra (Cf. previous Section) \sidecite{ekedahl2010}. For this reason, the ITER LHCD antenna design is based on a PAM antenna. However, its scalability to 5~\si{GHz} especially in terms of high power handling and Continuous Wave (CW) operations remains to be demonstrated. 

In ITER, a main parallel index of the launched waves $n_{\parallel 0} \approx 2.0$ has been selected as a trade-off between the current drive efficiency, the wave accessibility and the location of power deposition, all of which depend upon the plasma conditions\sidecite{becoulet2011}. In frame of an international work leaded by CEA/IRFM, a new arrangement of PAM has been studied in order to allow a larger $n_{\parallel}$ flexibility compared to the previous design\cite{bibet2005-1}, i.e. increasing the peak $n_{\parallel}$ range from $\left[1.9-2.1\right]$ to $\left[1.8-2.2\right]$. 

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{figures/chap3/ITER_antenna/ITER_LH_antenna}
	\caption{Illustration of the conceptual design of the ITER LHCD antenna. }
	\label{fig:iterlhantenna}
\end{figure}

In this design, the launcher is made of 48 identical modules, each one independently fed by one klystron: twelve in the toroidal direction and four in the poloidal direction. A module consists of four active waveguides in the toroidal direction and six lines of waveguides in the poloidal direction (Figure~\ref{fig:3D-view_1module}). Thus, the whole launcher contains 1152 active waveguides whose dimensions are $9.25\times58$~mm. The RF power is carried through a transmission line up to a RF window
located inside the frame and connected to a poloidal 3~dB splitter which feeds two $\TE_{10}-\TE_{30}$ mode converters. Each of these mode converters converts the incident power from the rectangular $\TE_{10}$ mode to the rectangular $\TE_{30}$ mode in order to divides the power into three poloidal rows, corresponding to the input of a 4-active waveguides multijunction. 

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/chap3/ITER_antenna/LH4ITER_1module}
	\caption{3D view of one module (RF modelling): the power is coming from the
		right of the figure, through the RF window, the hybrid junction, the
		two mode converters and the six PAM multijunctions. All the elements
		of a module located behind the RF window are under the machine vacuum.}
	\label{fig:3D-view_1module}
\end{figure}

An illustration of the multijunction design, with four active waveguides per toroidal line is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Illustration_4awg_design}. The passive waveguides, not illustrated in the Figure, are inserted between each active waveguides. In this design, the active waveguides (of width $b_{a}=9.25$~mm) are wider then passive waveguides ($b_{p}=7.25$~mm). The waveguides height ($a=58$~mm) avoids the higher mode $\TE_{20}$ to propagate and is close to the WR229 standard ($58.17\times29.08$~mm). 

The structure has been optimized in order to reach the following goals: i) minimize the reflected power, ii) insure a $270\si{\degree}$ phase shift between adjacent active waveguides. The estimated return loss of the optimized structure is $-34$~dB while the phase difference between adjacent output waveguides is $270\si{\degree} \pm 0.7\si{\degree}$. The transmitted power $\left|S_{n1}\right|^{2}$ (with $n=\{2,3,4,5\})$ is $1/4\pm7\times10^{-3}$ which means that the input power is well divided into the 4 output of the multijunction. The maximum electric field on matched ports is 346~kV/m for a power input of 250~kW, the propagation loss $1-\sum_{n} \left| S_{n1} \right|^{2}$ for copper walls is 1.2\% and the total length of the multijunction illustrated in Figure\ref{fig:Illustration_4awg_design} is $1.170$~m.

	\label{fig:Illustration_4awg_design} 
\end{figure}

The waveguide phasing is provided by one 180\si{\degree} phase shifter (in the second bi-junction) and three 90\si{\degree} phase shifters. 6 identical multijunctions are used to fill one row of a module of the ITER LHCD antenna. As in the 2001 initial design, 3 multijunctions disposed in a poloidal column are fed by a $\TE_{10}-\TE_{30}$ mode converter. This mode converter is detailled in Section~\ref{sec:mode_converter}.

The plasma coupling have been calculated using the ALOHA code\sidecite{hillairet2010} for 6 side-by-side modules, forming rows of 24 active waveguides. As a particular attention has been made on the power division in this model, thus on the reflected power due to the mechanical phase shifters. These phase shifters have been optimized in order to provide the expected relative phase shift thus to minimize the VSWR. As a result, the average reflection coefficient (Figure~\ref{fig:iterlhrc}) of this structure is lower than the 2001 version waveguide model, remaining below that 2\% over a large density range and showing that the reflected power of a multi-junction is almost as dependant to the RF structure than the edge plasma parameters.

\end{figure}

The maximum and averaged electric fields are plotted on Figure~\ref{fig:iterlhelectricfield}. As in the 2001 design, the electric field is maximum near the cut-off density (740-800~\si{kV/m} for $n_{e0}/n_c=1$) and is in the 580-600~\si{kV/m} range for $n_{e0}/n_c=2$. Above the cut-off, the average electric field is below 300~kV/m and decreases for higher densities.

\subsection{5 GHz ITER $\TE_{10}$-$\TE_{30}$ Mode Converters}\label{sec:mode_converter}
\marginnote{Part of this section are taken from \citeauthyear{hillairet2012, hillairet2020} and internal technical notes.}

% #####################################################
\subsubsection{Context}
The aim of the $\TE_{10}$-$\TE_{30}$ mode converter is to convert an input fundamental Transverse Electric (TE) rectangular mode ($\TE_{10}$) into another rectangular mode (the $\TE_{30}$ mode). This conversion is then used in order to equally split the power in three in an adapted splitter. Such splitting scheme, used in both Tore Supra LH antennas since 1999, is achieved by a perturbation of the waveguide geometry leading to mode coupling. Fundamental input $\TE_{10}$ mode can thus be almost totally converted to the $\TE_{30}$ mode, which ideally distributes the power into three in the H-plane\sidecite{bibet1994, wang2009}. This wall perturbation mode conversion has been used originally on ECRH, where high-order modes are not suitable for long distance transmission and plasma heating \cite{thumm1987-1, thumm2002}. 

Propagation of guided field into small perturbed wall waveguides can be modelled with the Generalized Telegraphist's equation \sidecite{schelkunoff1952, schelkunoff1955, unger1958, solymar1959, buckley1990}. The resulting set of equations can be solved numerically \sidecite{flugel1988,huting1989} or almost analytically with some approximations\cite{unger1958, solymar1959}. 

We refer to the previous references for more details on the calculation principles. 

% #####################################################
\subsubsection{RF modelling}
\paragraph{Mode Converter}
The schematic drawing of a H-plane sinusoidal perturbated wall mode converter is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:SchematicMC}. In Figure \ref{fig:SchematicMC}, the input $\mbox{TE}_{10}$ mode is coming from the left. Input width $a_{0}$ must be set sufficiently large in order to permit the $\TE_{30}$ mode to propagate, leading to $a_{0}\geqslant90$~mm at 5~GHz. Output width $a_{1}$ is set to insure the $\mbox{T}\mbox{E}_{50}$ mode to cut-off, i.e. $a_{1}\leqslant150$~mm. The $\mbox{TE}_{40}$ modes is able to propagate at the output width $a_{1}$, however, an incident odd TE mode upon an H-plane discontinuity
with a longitudinal symmetry only excites odd TE modes in rectangular waveguides. A similar conclusion is obtained in the case of even modes\sidenote{See Ref.\sidecite{dusseaux2000, dusseaux2008} for an elegant derivation of this property}.  

\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/chap3/ITER_modeconverter/MC_SchematicCM}
	\caption{Schematic drawing (H-plane cut) of the $\TE_{10}-\TE_{30}$
		mode converter. }
	\label{fig:SchematicMC}
\end{figure}

The mode evolution along the mode converter is obtained by solving the generalized telegraphist's equations for a 3.5 periods deformed waveguide of wavelength $\lambda_{w}$ defined by the following sinusoidal
perturbation\cite{buckley1990, bibet1994}:

\begin{equation}
a(z)=a_{0}+\varepsilon\left(1-\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{\lambda_{w}}z\right)\right)\label{eq:sinusoidalPerturbation}
\end{equation}
In order to reach the best mode conversion to $\TE_{30}$ mode, a numerical optimization of parameters $a_{0}$, $\varepsilon$ and $\lambda_{w}$ has been made in Matlab using a Generalized Telegraphist's equation solver. This first optimization led to dimensions $a_{0}=98$\,mm, $\varepsilon=22.4$\,mm and $k_{w}=2\pi/\lambda_{w}=36.3059\,\mbox{m}^{-1}$.

\begin{marginfigure}

	\caption{HFSS RF model of the mode converter (without taper at the input).}
	\label{fig:HFSS-RF-modelMC}
\end{marginfigure}

Further optimization of these parameters have been made into ANSYS HFSS, taking into account RF conduction losses on walls. In order to avoid spurious mode generation or numerical instabilities, some extra straight rectangular waveguides have been added at the input and output of the HFSS model (Figure \ref{fig:HFSS-RF-modelMC}).  This optimization led to the dimensions reported in Table \ref{tab:DimensionsMC}, which are very close to the ones found in Matlab.

\end{table}

The return loss for the fundamental mode is 20.5~dB. Propagation losses for copper plating walls, calculated as $1-\sum_{j}\left|S_{j1}\right|^{2}$, is 1.36\%. The bandwidth of the device, defined as the range of frequencies for which at least 95\% of the $\TE_{10}$ mode is converted to $\TE_{30}$, is 120~MHz.
The length of the device is, without taking into account input and output straight rectangular waveguides, 606~mm.


In order to feed the mode converter with a standard WR-229 waveguide ($a=58.17$~mm, $b=29.08$~mm), 
an input taper has to be added to match the WR-229 width. This taper is described in the next section.

% #####################################################
\paragraph{Input Taper}
\begin{marginfigure}
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/chap3/ITER_modeconverter/HFSS_ModeConverterTaper}
	\caption{RF Model of the Input Taper. }
	\label{fig:taper}
\end{marginfigure}
In order to make the transition between the input width $a_{0}$ of the mode converter and the conventional waveguide WR-229 width which is 58~mm, an extra taper must be added at the input (instead of the straight rectangular waveguide used before). A cosine taper has been modelled with the following width equation:

\begin{equation}
a(z)=\frac{1}{2} 
\left(a_{\mbox{WR229}}+a_{0}\right)
+\frac{1}{2}\left(a_{\mbox{WR229}}+a_{0}\right)
\cos\left[\left(\frac{z}{L_{taper}}-1\right)\pi\right]
\end{equation}
where $L_{\mbox{taper}}$ is the total length of the taper, $a_{\mbox{WR229}}$ is the WR-229 width (58.17\,mm) and $a_{0}$ the input width of the mode converter. The model has been drawn in ANSYS HFSS and then optimized in combination with mode converter. Scattering parameters are reported in Table \ref{tab:S-ParametersALL}. Let us define the forward mode conversion efficiency as the ratio between the power carried by the $\TE_{30}$ over the total forward power. According to the S-parameters, the theoretical mode conversion efficiency is close of 99.5\%.

\end{marginfigure}
The poloidal splitter aims to split the power coming from the mode converter, which is mainly a pure $\mbox{TE}_{30}$ mode, into three distinct waveguide sections. This poloidal divider is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:PoloidalSplitterCAD}. It has been optimized first alone in order to maximize the power splitting when exciting with a $\mbox{TE}_{30}$ mode, then with the mode converter fastened. The calculated scattering parameters of this device are reported in Table \ref{tab:PoloidalSplitter_Sparameters}.

\end{table}

\paragraph{Complete assembly}
The complete assembly, i.e. the mode converter associated to its input taper and the poloidal splitter has  a calculated return loss is 45.5~dB. The transmission losses are 4.79~dB $\pm$~0.01~dB for the three ports, close to the ideal value 4.77~dB which corresponding to the third of the input power. The scattering parameters evolution on a 4.9-5.1~GHz frequency band are reported in the next section.

\subsubsection{Low Power RF Measurements}
A low power mock-up of this 5~GHz mode converter (with its input taper) has been manufactured at CEA/IRFM using a 2-axis numerical drilling machine in Aluminum directly from the CAD model. The poloidal splitter as well as some other waveguide elements used only for measurement purposes, such as the "pull-over" described in the next section, have been manufactured by the SUMIX company from CAD models. The top of each elements has been screw tight in order to insure a very good RF contact (Figure~\ref{fig:ModeConverterMockUpElements}). 

\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/chap3/ITER_modeconverter/LH4ITER_ModeConverterMockUpElements}
	\caption{Manufactured low RF power mock-up elements. From top left to bottom right: mode converter,  "pull-over" and E-field probe waveguide support. }
	\label{fig:ModeConverterMockUpElements}
\end{figure}

The test bed used to measure the mode converter consisted in the assembly of the mode converter, the poloidal splitter and the ''pull-over''. The aim of this last element is only to facilitate the measurements by putting the output ports aside. Some WR187-WR229 tapers have also been added at each ports in order to match the commercially available WR187 waveguide-to-coaxial transitions (Figure~\ref{fig:RFTestBed}).

	\label{fig:RFTestBed}
\end{figure}

RF measurements indicate a return loss of 40~dB and a transmission loss of 4.78~dB $\pm$~0.03~dB for the three ports, very close from the ideal 4.77~dB corresponding to the third of the input power. Amplitude measurement results are illustrated in Figures \ref{fig:ModeConverter_S11} and \ref{fig:ModeConverter_S21}; results are in good agreement with the numerical modelling of the complete assembly. The phase shift between the side ports and the center port is $180\deg\pm5\deg$ as expected by the modelling.

\subsubsection{Mode Conversion Efficiency}
In order to measure the forward conversion efficiency from $\TE_{10}$ mode to $\TE_{30}$, a dedicated waveguide element has been manufactured. This element allows direct electric field probing of the mode converter output section, in which an almost pure $\TE_{30}$ mode is expected. This element is illustrated in Figures~\ref{fig:ModeConverterMockUpElements} (bottom right picture ) and \ref{fig:RFTestBed}. It consists in a straight waveguide of section $142.8~\si{mm}\times29.08~\si{mm}\times308~\si{mm}$, which matches the output section of the mode converter. Three rows of holes (2~mm diameter, 10~mm spaced) are drilled in the H-plane. These holes are made to support and block the probe in order to make the measurements at the exactly same spatial locations while holding the probe in a vertical position. The probe is inserted inside each hole sequentially and measures the amplitude and the phase of the electric field inside the waveguide. The coupling element is a thin 1mm diameter copper wire.  The probe ground potential is connected to the waveguide. The coupling has been measured to be -49~dB. Once the probe is inserted into a probe hole, the coupling element supersedes the waveguide wall by less than 1 mm. It is supposed from the small dimensions of the probe that the perturbations due to its use are negligible.  

From these electric field measurements, the modal content after the mode converter can then be deduced with the following method\sidenote{This method is not unique. This modelling is given  as exercise to students during the Master Fusion hands-on in Cadarache. Along the year, many different methods have been found and are summarized in  \href{https://github.com/jhillairet/documents/blob/master/notebooks/TP\%20Master\%20Fusion/LH-Hands-on-multijunction.ipynb}{this Jupyter Notbook}. }. We first assume that the electromagnetic field inside the waveguide is a linear combination of $\TE_{m0}$ modes only, then from at a point $(x,z)$ of the waveguide we have from Eq.(\ref{eq:rectwg_transverse_fields_sum_modes}):
\begin{equation}
\Ebf_{t}(x,z)
	=
	\sum_{m=1}^{N_{modes}}
	A_{m} \ebf_{m}^{+} \left(x,z\right) + B_{m} \ebf_{m}^{-} \left(x,z\right) 
\end{equation}
where $x$ is the largest side direction and $z$ is the propagation direction. The $\ebf_{m}^{\pm}$ terms are the analytic modal eigenfunctions describing forward and backward $\TE_{m0}$ modes shapes given in Eqs.(\ref{eq:TEmodes_eingenfunctions}). $A_{m}$ and $B_{m}$ are the associated forward and backward weight coefficients.  The aim of the method is to find the $2\times N_{modes}$ best coefficients $A_{m}$,$B_{m}$  in order to minimize the squares of the error $\chi^{2}$ between the theoretical field and the measured field:
\begin{equation}
\chi^{2}\left(A_{m},B_{m}\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{N_{mes}}\left(E_{mes,i}-E_{th,i}\right)^{2} 
\end{equation}
Solving this problem leads to the forward $A_{m}$ and backward $B_{m}$ coefficients, and thus to the forward mode conversion efficiency which can be defined as the ratio between the power carried by the $\TE_{30}$ over the power carried by all forward modes, i.e:
\begin{equation}
\eta=\frac{\left|A_{3}\right|^{2}}{\sum_{n}\left|A_{n}\right|^{2}}\times100
\end{equation}

This efficiency has been calculated from the electric field probing after the mode converter to be $\eta=99.9$\%.

\subsubsection{Summary of this Section}
In the frame of the Lower Hybrid R\&D for ITER activities conducted at CEA/IRFM, a low power mock-up of a $\TE_{10}-\TE_{30}$ mode converter at 5~GHz has been designed, manufactured and successfully validated with low power RF measurements. The next section is dedicated to another ITER LHCD system component, the RF windows.

\subsubsection{Context}
\marginnote{Parts of this section are taken from \citeauthyear{hillairet2015}.}
A tokamak operates at pressures different from the transmission line pressure. RF windows intend to isolate these different pressures but allow propagation of the microwaves with low losses and limited RF power reflection. Vacuum vessel operates at ultra-low pressure, typically $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-6}$~\si{Pa}, while transmission lines can contain atmospheric pressure or pressurized gas to increase the breakdown voltage. Consequently, the window must be sufficiently strengthened to withstand differential pressures of the order of several tens of \si{kPa}. On the other hand, window must withstand mechanical stresses such as shock and vibration, and important temperature variations. Window failures can be caused by reflected power, vacuum arcs/multipactor or too much heat dissipation \sidecite{vaughan1961, ikeda1989, neuber1998, hemmert1998}. In the case of a fusion reactor such like ITER, the windows are also part of the first nuclear confinement barrier.

As the dimensions of the tokamak access ports are limited, the number of transmission lines connected to the antenna is limited too. In order to fit into the available space, to simplify the assembly design and to improve the maintenance of the system, the number of transmission lines and thus the number of RF windows must be kept as low as possible. This leads to increase the power handling capability of each transmission line, and ultimately of each window.

In the proposed ITER LHCD design (Cf. Section~\ref{sec:ITER_LHCD_antenna}), 24~\si{MW}~CW of RF power at 5~\si{GHz} are expected to be generated and transmitted to the plasma. In order to separate the vacuum vessel pressure from the cryostat waveguide pressure, forty eight 5~\si{GHz} 500~\si{kW} windows are to be assembled on the waveguides at the equatorial port flange. For nuclear safety reasons, 48 additional windows could be located in the cryostat section, to separate the cryostat waveguide pressure from the exterior transmission line pressure and to monitor it. Because the failure of a window would lead to lock a transmission line, these windows have been identified as one of the main critical components for the ITER LHCD system since first ITER LHCD studies \sidecite{bibet2005}. In order to initiate this R\&D effort, two 5~\si{GHz} 500~\si{kW}/5~s pill-box prototype windows have been developed and manufactured in 2012 by the PMB/ALCEN Company in close collaboration with the CEA/IRFM\sidecite{hillairet2014, hillairet2015}.

	\caption{Pill-box window schematics}
	\label{fig:pillboxwindow}
\end{marginfigure}

The proposed ITER 5~\si{GHz} RF window is based on a pill-box window concept \sidecite[+4cm]{ives1993,maebara1995}, i.e. a thin ceramic disc brazed in the middle of a short straight section of a circular waveguide axially connected on both sides to rectangular waveguides as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:pillboxwindow}. According to the transmission line theory, the pill-box window has four discontinuities: rectangular waveguide to circular waveguide, vacuum to ceramic and ceramic to vacuum and circular waveguide to rectangular waveguide. Typical design rule of thumb of such device is circular section diameter about the same size of the diagonal of the rectangular waveguide. Without taking into account the ceramic, the circular section length is approximately half a guided wavelength of the circular $\TE_{11}$ mode, in order to not generate spurious reflection into the rectangular sections. For a prescribed dielectric properties, the RF design consists in optimizing the geometrical dimensions of the window, mainly the diameter, the ceramic thickness and the vacuum circular waveguide length in order to minimize both RF reflection (matching) and RF power absorption in the ceramic (from trapped or ghost-mode heating \cite{ives1993} ). Once optimized, taking into account the ceramic, the matching is optimum only for a narrow band of frequency and is very sensitive to the device dimensions and the ceramic relative permittivity. As the klystrons used for fusion applications have narrow bandwidth, for instance 5~MHz at 3.7~GHz \sidecite[-1cm]{beunas2009, magne2011} or 5~GHz klystrons \sidecite{kenichihayashi2007, park2013}, the RF optimization is performed for the central frequency only. 

The heat losses in the ceramic, which have to be extracted by an active water cooling, depend on both the inside electric field topology and the ceramic dielectric loss (loss tangent). Undesirable modes due to parasitic resonances can be excited in the ceramic volume, raising the electric field and thus the heat dissipation. This aspect is uncorrelated from the return loss and one can even achieve low return loss but can have high heat losses in the ceramic (>2~\si{kW}) \sidecite{mirizzi2011}. So both aspects have to be taken into account during the RF optimization process.


\begin{marginfigure}

	\caption{ITER 2001 Conceptual Design from \cite{bibet2001-1}}
	\label{fig:iterlhantennaold}
\end{marginfigure}


In the 2001 initial Lower Hybrid (LH) antenna design, 24 RF windows were set on the cryostat port. Each of them fed 2 RF windows installed on the vacuum port (illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:iterlhantennaold}). Since the antenna is designed for a power up to 20 MW, each RF window of the first and second group have to withstand respectively 833 kW CW and 417 kW CW . Two preliminary designs had been proposed in \sidecite[+3.5cm]{bibet2001-1}. However, the mechanical analysis performed in \sidecite[+4cm]{hoang2009-2} showed that stresses are higher than the static fatigue limit of 50 MPa. This particularly point invalidates the design for dynamic fatigue (cycles of repeated heating and cooling). Following this study, a new RF design has been developed. At the contrary of the model proposed in \cite{bibet2001-1}, a larger rectangular input section has been used (WR229 instead of WR187). It was found in \sidecite[+2cm]{hillairet2013} a range of dielectric thickness which combines low total dielectric losses (<650W) by minimizing the axial electric field in the ceramic and a low VSWR (S11<-25dB). We did not take into account in this study the impact of non-negligible amount of reflected power (>5\%), such as experimented on tokamak.

As highlighted in \sidecite{ao2014}, the relative dielectric properties of the ceramic disk depend on the manufacturer, even when the same manufacturer and ceramic batch are used. At the frequency of 5~GHz, the dielectric losses (loss tangent) of aluminium oxide (Al2O3), aluminium nitride (AlN) or Beryllium Oxyde (BeO) are of the same order ($\tan\delta \approx 10^{-4}$). The choice for BeO ceramic is motivated by its larger thermal conductivity (in the range of 330 to 370~\si{W/m/K} at room temperature) than the other ones (in the range of 30~\si{W/m/K} for Al2O3 and 70-180~\si{W/m/K} for AlN). BeO is used in high power 3.7~GHz and 5~GHz klystrons windows. In order to determine the final thickness of the windows, the BeO ceramic RF properties must be known with accuracy. A BeO sample has been requested from the ceramic manufacturer (American Beryllia) with the guarantee that the final ceramics will be made from the same lot. The sample has been characterized within a RF resonant cavity setup in collaboration with the XLIM laboratory\sidenote{The authors thanks Olivier Tantot and Damien Passerieux from the XLIM Laboratory in Limoges, France, where the dielectric measurements on BeO samples have been conducted.} \sidecite[+3cm]{lefloch2014}. The measurement of the BeO sample has been made at two surrounding frequencies and the results are given in \cite{hillairet2015}. The relative permittivity and the loss tangent at 5~GHz have been calculated from a linear interpolation of the measured values, to be $\varepsilon_{r}=6.36\pm0.159$ and $\tan \delta = 4.30\times 10^{-4}\pm3.82\times 10^{-5}$ respectively. 

\begin{marginfigure}[-3cm]

	\caption{Main dimensions of the final 5 GHz RF window prototype. }
	\label{fig:iterwindowsmaindimensions}
\end{marginfigure}

From these measurements, the final dimensions have been calculated by the PMB/ALCEN Company in collaboration with CEA. In the proposed design, a rectangular waveguide of section 58.17x29.08~\si{mm} (WR229 standard) is used to forward the RF power into the circular section. The ceramic disk diameter and the thickness are 85.89~mm and 8.3~mm respectively. Other dimensions are reported in Figure~\ref{fig:iterwindowsmaindimensions}. In order to increase the RF performance of the window, in particular the return loss, two matching inductive rods have been added on each side of the window. These rods also make possible an eventual post-manufacturing tuning, by slightly deforming them after the final assembly. This technique has also been used in the TED 3.7~GHz windows used on the Tore Supra tokamak, but with a larger rod diameter due to the reduced frequency.

	\label{fig:iterwindowsrflossesceramic}
\end{marginfigure}

The power loss in the ceramic volume and the electric field topology have been evaluated with finite element modelling (Figure~\ref{fig:iterwindowsrflossesceramic}. With the material properties cited above, the calculated dissipated power in ceramic is around 550~W for 500~kW input on matched load. Taking into account a conservative copper conductivity of 4.4~MS/m, the total resistive losses are estimated to 720~W (Figure~\ref{fig:iterwindowsrflosses}). Combined, the expected total RF losses for the window to evacuate is thus of the order of 1.27~kW.

\end{figure}


In order to conform to ITER acceptance criteria for vacuum feedthroughs \sidecite{waldon2008}, the maximum pressure on the ceramic (air) has been specified to be 3~bars absolute (0.3~MPa). The water cooling circuit specifications has been specified in accordance with the NFRI 5~GHz klystron test-bed in which the high power tests have been performed\sidecite{do2011, kim2019-2}. The maximum pressure on the cooling circuit has been set to 6~bars, with a maximum pressure drop on the cooling circuit for a 8~L/min flow of 0.3~bar\footnote{It has to be noted that these specifications are well below the ITER port plug specifications, for which the water temperature and pressure are expected to be 70-100$\si{\celsius}$ up to 40~bars in cooling mode and up to 250$\si{\celsius}$ and 45~bars in baking mode. However, such conditions are challenging because the copper skirt thickness has to be increased to sustain such a pressure. Increasing the skirt thickness in order to withstand a 40-45~bars pressure will reduce the cooling efficiency. Moreover, if the skirt is thicker, the mechanical constraints on the ceramic due to the differential thermal expansion between the BeO and Cu will be more severe since the skirt will be stiffer. For this reason, the present proposed prototype design only focuses on the RF performances.}. 

Assuming an inlet flow of 8~L/min and an outlet return pressure of 1.5~bar specified by the water cooling loop system, the fluid velocity calculated from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling in ANSYS Fluent at the 10~mm diameter inlet is 1.7~m/s. Figure~\ref{fig:iterwindowswatervelocity} illustrates the water velocity in half of the cooling section. The flow in the fluid section is mainly turbulent, as the Reynold number at the inlet/outlet is of the order of 10000 and 40000 in the skirt. Since inlet and outlet have been located normal to the skirt, the water velocity rise up to 4.6 m/s at the interface between the pipe and the skirt. However, the flow is rapidly homogenous in the skirt and with lower velocities (cf. Figure~\ref{fig:iterwindowswatervelocity_closeup_skirt}), leading to an homogenous cooling of the ceramic. The average value of the heat transfer coefficient is H=12300~\si{W.m^{-2}K^{-1}} on the inner side of the skirt. The water pressure is homogenous inside the skirt and the estimated pressure drop is 0.12~bar. Cavitation regime is not expected in the cooling section, as the cavitation number is more than two orders of magnitude above the critical threshold ($\mathrm{Ca}\approx 1$) in all situations.\marginnote{The \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_number_(physics)}{Cavitation number} ($\mathrm{Ca}$) is a dimensionless number used in flow calculations. It expresses the relationship between the difference of a local absolute pressure from the vapor pressure and the kinetic energy per volume, and is used to characterize the potential of the flow to cavitate. }

\end{marginfigure}

The thermal model of the window has been set-up using loading from both the electromagnetic (heat load on walls and ceramic) and CFD models (convection on the skirt). A first thermal steady-state study has been conducted to survey the maximum reached temperature. The thermal loads come from the RF losses in the ceramic and on the waveguides walls and coupled to the thermal model. The thermal sinks come from water cooling and air radiation. The rectangular waveguide parts and the skirt are modelled as OFHC copper. The connections between the elements, especially between the BeO and the copper skirt, are modelled as perfect (bonded). The mechanical parameters of the BeO used in the thermal model are reported in \cite{hillairet2015}. The thermal conductivity of the BeO has been kept constant with respect to the temperature. However some studies indicate however that the thermal conductivity drops with temperature\sidecite{defaoite2012}, which would increase the BeO temperature. 

As the matching rods are not directly cooled by the water circuit, their temperatures reach 180$\si{\degreeCelsius}$ after a 5 seconds pulse and nearly 290$\si{\degreeCelsius}$ in steady-state regime. For this reason, the nominal RF pulse duration of these prototypes has been limited to be 5 seconds as a conservative approach. For a CW design, cooling pipes on the upper and lower parts of the rectangular waveguides would solve the problem.

In the ceramic, the maximum temperature is reached at the centre where the dielectric loss density is the maximum and which is also the farthest point from the water heat sink. Starting from an initial water temperature of 22$\si{\degreeCelsius}$, the ceramic centre temperature is calculated to be 75$\si{\degreeCelsius}$ after a 5 s/500 kW pulse (Figure~\ref{fig:iterwindows_thermal_modeling}). The initial temperature of the ceramic is recovered after nearly 10 s, as illustrated in Figure 8. In order to limit the mechanical stresses on the ceramic, the temperature difference between the centre and the periphery of the disk must be kept under a safety limit of 80$\si{\degreeCelsius}$. This limit has been determined by both mechanical modelling and rule of thumb, in order to keep stresses in the ceramic below the static fatigue limit.

\end{marginfigure}
Two RF windows have been manufactured by the PMB/ALCEN Company in collaboration with CEA/IRFM (Figure~\ref{fig:iterwindowspicture}). For ensuring the possibility to perform ITER relevant tests, like high temperature baking up to 240$\si{\degreeCelsius}$ , the window flanges are non-standard and have been designed to be compatible for both Viton or Helicoflex seals. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:iterwindowsgeometry}, a rectangular groove is machined on both sides of the window. Male waveguide adapters are then required to connect the window: these adapters are designed to insure a good electrical contact at the flange by a heel slightly longer than the groove depth, in order to dissociate the electrical contact from the sealing aspects. In return, additional elements must be connected together, which can lead to additional losses in the transmission line.

\end{figure}

BeO ceramic has a high secondary electron emission coefficient, which enhances multipactor induced breakdown probability. In order to suppress the multipactor induced breakdown at the surface of the ceramic, a 10~\si{nm} titanium nitride (TiN) coating is applied by vapour deposition. This coating intends to decrease the secondary emission yield of the ceramic and to improve the electrical charge exchange \sidecite{lorkiewicz2004} . Stainless-steel parts facing the RF fields are copper coated (10 to 20~$\si{\mu m}$).  After brazing the rectangular copper waveguides elements together, the stainless-steel parts are TiG welded. 

Low power RF measurements (dBm level) are reported in Figure~\ref{fig:iterwindowsrl} for both windows, labelled \#1 and \#2. The return losses ($S_{11}$ and $S_{22}$) at 5~GHz are below -32~dB (SWR < 1.05:1) in accordance with the RF modelling. The optimum frequency is shifted to low frequencies by 20 to 40~MHz, for reasons that will be explained in the next section. It has to be noted that the return losses $S_{11}$ and $S_{22}$ are not symmetrical for both windows, differently from the results of the RF modelling. This fact is attributed to both the measurement errors (which come from RF cables) and the matching rods which were deformed during manufacturing. These deformations, due to a handling problem during the copper coating operation, have been experienced for both windows. Even if the rods have been reshaped with specific tooling as best as possible, slight mechanical differences exist between each rods (at the contrary of the RF model which is ideal and perfectly symmetric).

	\caption{Return loss [\si{dB}] for both windows. RF modelling prediction(plain black) from HFSS}
	\label{fig:iterwindowsrl}
\end{figure}

The insertion losses ($S_{21}$) are reported in Figure~\ref{fig:iterwindowsil}. They have been measured at 5~GHz in the range from -0.01 dB to -0.05 dB (i.e. between 0.23\% and 1.14\% of input power). The overall uncertainty of the transmission losses measurements is of the order of 0.03 dB. These measurements reflected not only the window transmission losses but also the part of the assembly for which no calibration was possible (such as the dedicated waveguides adapters with specific flanges). Precise measurements of the insertion losses are very sensitive to the test bed mechanical assembly, in particular to the quality of the mechanical assembly of all flanges.

	\label{fig:iterwindowsil}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{High Power RF Tests}
High power measurements have been performed on the NFRI LH test bed in 2013 and 2014. The setup shown in Figure~\ref{fig:iterwindowsrftests} consists in a single window inserted in the transmission line. The transmission line is filled with SF6 gas. A vacuum test with both windows at the same time using an interspace pumping system was also expected in case of successful completion of the tests of both prototypes. The windows were cooled with 8 to 17~\si{L/min} water flow at 20-25$\si{\degreeCelsius}$. Calorimetric measurements of the window water cooling loop were recorded during shots and used to estimate the power losses in the window\sidecite{park2013}. The temperature of the ceramic core was monitored by an infra-red camera (Agema thermovision 900, spectral range 2-5.4 \si{µm}) during 500~kW RF power shots. The measured BeO temperature depends on the BeO emissivity which is unknown. An absolute temperature calibration has been performed between 24.3$\si{\degreeCelsius}$ to 81.$\si{\degreeCelsius}$ using electrical blanket heating and shows a linear trend. Higher temperatures are deduced assuming linear interpolation of the calibration curve. 

\begin{figure}

	\caption{High power test setup at 5GHz/500kW NFRI test bed in Korea.}
	\label{fig:iterwindowsrftests}
\end{figure}

The RF energy applied for both windows is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:iterwindowspulseenergy} as a function of the pulse number. The RF power has been applied during single pulses length of 100~ms starting from 25~kW, and then the power was increased progressively pulse by pulse by 25~kW steps up to 250~kW. RF pulse length has been increased progressively (in more than 30~pulses) up to 2.5~s at a power of 250~kW. The RF power has been increased up to 500~kW during 100~ms pulses, then the pulse length have been increased to few seconds at 500~kW, in more than 50 pulses. Repetitive pulses at 500 kW have been performed for different pulse lengths. A single breakdown event has been detected via the optical fiber protection system at 250~kW. The fraction of reflected power measured close to the klystron output ranged from -22.6~dB to -21.6~dB (VSWR 1.16:1 to 1.18:1) for the first window and from -21.2~dB to -20.8~dB (VSWR 1.19:1 to 1.2:1) for the second window. It has to be noted that the return losses are inclusive of the return losses produces by both the window and the whole assembly, including its various components such as bends and water loads, for which a -24.9~dB (VSWR 1.12:1) return loss has been measured without the window installed in the transmission line.

\begin{figure}

	\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{figures/chap3/ITER_window/ITER_windows_pulse_energy}
	\caption{Pulse Energy in kJ as a function of the pulse number for both windows.}
	\label{fig:iterwindowspulseenergy}
\end{figure}

The water temperature increase $\Delta T$ during the RF power application from calorimetric measurement indicated a power loss in the device from 0.89\% to 1.1\% of the input power for the first window and of 0.7\% for the second window. This power loss includes the ceramic but also all the neighbouring copper-plated waveguide sections at both sides of the window, which were not water-cooled during these tests. This value is well above the 0.2\% expected from RF modelling or best measured values, but is consistent with the lowest range of values from low-power measurements reported in Section~\ref{sec:ITER_windows_manuf_low_power_tests}. These values are also in the same range of the ones measured on the Toshiba 5 GHz RF windows which equipped the klystron\sidecite{kim2019-2} . Total loss versus input power for both windows is reported in Figure 14 and shows linear trends. Two trend curves are related to the first window (1.1\% and 0.89\% of the incident power Pin) and the third one to the second window (0.73\% of Pin). The total losses are larger in the first window than in the second window, in consistence with low power measurements. The difference in the trends for the first window is not explained and is thought to come from measurement dispersion. These linear trends exclude eventual non-linear loss processes during these short-length pulses (up to 5 s).

\end{figure}

Infra-red (IR) measurements of the ceramic temperature have been made during high power pulses.  The rods small diameter (1.6 mm) makes its temperature measurement difficult because of the camera resolution, but also mainly because of the IR reflections occurring on them. When the ceramic temperature is increasing, the rods become undistinguishable from the ceramic. Some thermocouples have been placed at the top of the window (cf Figure~\ref{fig:iterwindowsgeometry}), located specifically over the matching rods, but no change of temperature during the pulses was measured, in agreement with modelling. The ceramic central temperature (maximum temperature), measured by the IR camera after 3 seconds pulses at 500 kW (Figure 15), is recurrently higher than 250$\si{\degreeCelsius}$, and thus higher than the thermal modelling prediction illustrated in Figure 8 which was below 100$\si{\degreeCelsius}$ after a 5 s pulse. 

\begin{figure}

Moreover, the cooling time constant is around twice larger than expected from ideal thermal modelling, indicating that a thermal barrier reduces the heat conduction efficiency. The losses are not affected by a degradation of the cooling efficiency as the dissupated power does not depend on the thermal conductivity (if we assume that the dielectric loss tangent does not change with the temperature increase). 

The fact that the BeO central temperature increases to temperatures higher than 300$\si{\degreeCelsius}$ prevent these two windows prototype to be used in CW regime at full power without exceeding the mechanical stress limits of the ceramic. The first ceramic window prototype was found to be cracked after disassembly from the test-bed. Following this observation, the maximum power and the pulse length has been reduced for the following tests of the second window, in order not to exceed a maximum IR measured temperature of 100$\si{\degreeCelsius}$ to avoid high temperature gradient between the ceramic core and its periphery cooled by the 20-25$\si{\degreeCelsius}$ water loop. 



\subsubsection{Experimental Results Analysis}

Following the high power tests, two 16 mm diameter samples have been machined from the first (cracked) BeO ceramic window. A post-mortem RF analysis of these two samples has been performed with the same methodology used for the manufacturer sample (Cf. Section\ref{sec:ITER_windows_manuf_low_power_tests}). The relative permittivity measured on these two pieces was $6.74\pm0.12$ and $6.72\pm0.01$, to be compared with the 6.36 value originally measured on the manufacturer sample. The $\tan \delta$ was also up to twice higher than expected from the BeO sample measurement (from $5.4\times10^{-4}$ up to $8.8\times10^{-4} \pm 1.1\times 10^{-5}$). RF modelling shows that the change of relative permittivity has little effect on the dielectric losses, indicating that no other higher order modes are excited in the ceramic. The change of permittivity shifts the optimum frequency by -20~MHz, which corroborates low power measurements (Figure~\ref{fig:iterwindowsrl}). A loss tangent value of $9\times10^{-4}$ leads to double the total losses in the ceramic. Doubling the dielectric loss tangent into an ideal thermal model leads to a BeO central temperature of nearly 140$\si{\degreeCelsius}$ after a 5~s pulse. However, even taking into account these changes in the reference RF model, the predicted total RF losses reach 2~kW, still far from the 5~kW and 2.5~kW measured by calorimetry for window \#1 and \#2 respectively. 

We observe in Figure~\ref{fig:iterwindowspowerloss} that the total losses are almost linear with respect to the input power, thus excluding any significant changes on the dielectric loss tangent or copper conductivity with temperature for these short-length pulses.  The effect of the reflected power from the waveguide bends and the water loads has been assessed and is marginal in the total RF losses evaluation. Adding small gaps between the bonded parts of the window or at the flange interfaces may possibly causes additional RF losses. However, a reliable estimate of these losses is difficult. As the power lost in the ceramic is linearly linked to the dielectric loss tangent, the latter is thought to be the dominant player.

As seen in Figure~\ref{fig:iterwindowsrftests}, the window is connected to copper waveguide adapters on both sides. Each side is the addition of two waveguide sections of 140~mm and 248~mm length respectively. As these waveguides attached to the window were not actively cooled, a fraction of the RF power lost into them participates to the power balance measured by the calorimetric method. With a realistic copper conductivity of $\sigma=44~\si{MS/m}$, the conduction losses  from Eq.(\ref{eq:rectwg_power_loss_per_unit_length}) for a WR229 waveguide at 5~GHz for 500~kW are 2.9~kW/m. Taking into account only the two 140 mm length waveguides, the power balance leads to an additional RF power loss of 810~W. Taking into account all the waveguides length (140~mm + 248~mm) the power balance leads to an additional RF power loss of 2300~W. However, estimating the real fraction of power lost in these waveguides and dissipated into the window water cooling loop is delicate because of the large uncertainty of the thermal contacts between flanges. 

Taking into account the post-mortem BeO RF properties in the RF model leads to an insertion loss of -0.02 dB (0.5\%) and -0.03 dB (0.7\%) if one includes the connection waveguides on each sides of the window. Modelling and measurements are then consistent if one assumes that between 5 and 20\% of the power measured by calorimetry is dissipated in the connection waveguides. These modelling however do not take into account the fact that the matching rods are slightly deformed.

The longer characteristic time measured from IR during cooling can be originated from either a decreased BeO thermal conductivity, a reduced water heat transfer coefficient or a thermal barrier between the BeO and the copper skirt. If the first two have little effect on the thermal modelling results, unless using non-realistic values, the latter is thought to be the main cause of a reduced cooling efficiency. The brazing layer is made of gold/copper alloys (Au50/Cu50) in order to avoid silver alloys, which are undesirable in ITER because of transmutation risks during the nuclear phase. This brazing material has a low thermal conductivity (in the order of 33~\si{W/m/K}). Moreover, in order to increase the wettability of the BeO to the brazing alloy, a metallization of the BeO periphery is performed using a Molybdenum/Manganese layer, with the addition of nickel plating. Both have also a low thermal conductivity. Taking into account the Molybdenum/Manganese layer which has an electrical conductivity about 6~MS/m in the RF model as an impedance boundary condition leads to increase the RF losses around the ceramic of about 10~W for 500~kW input. Thermal modelling of such brazing layers, which thickness is typically between 20 to 40~µm, is delicate and is highly sensitive to parameter values. However, the general trend when applying a degraded thermal contact at the interface between the BeO and the copper is a fast increase of the temperature rise time due to a thermal barrier effect and similarly an increase of the characteristic cooling time, both observed experimentally. 


\subsubsection{Summary of this section}
Two 5 GHz 500 kW/5 s windows have been designed and tested at high power in collaboration with NFRI. The window design relies on a symmetrical pill-box concept with a cylindrical beryllium oxide (BeO) ceramic brazed on an actively water cooled copper skirt. The ceramic RF properties have been measured on a manufacturer test sample in order to get realistic values for guiding the design. Low power measurements show return losses below -32 dB (VSWR < 1.05:1) and insertion losses between -0.01 dB and -0.05 dB (i.e. 0.23\% to 1.14\% of input power), with the optimum frequency shifted toward frequencies lower than the nominal one. High power tests conducted at NFRI show a total power loss of 1.1\% of the input power for one window and of 0.7\% for the second one, in agreement with the lowest range of cold RF measurement but not with initial RF simulations. These values are also in the same range than the ones measured on the two Toshiba 5 GHz RF windows which equipped the klystron. The ceramic temperature during RF pulses has been found to reach unexpected high values, preventing these windows to be used under CW conditions because of the ceramic stress limits. 

Post-mortem RF measurement of two BeO samples of one of the windows shows that the dielectric relative permittivity of the ceramic was 6.7 while for the sample initially measured it was 6.36. More important, the measured dielectric loss tangent on the two post-mortem ceramic samples is up to twice as high as the manufacturer sample. The difference in the permittivity explains the shift of the optimum frequency.  RF modelling including the new dielectric properties of BeO, a more realistic RF conduction loss rate on copper and the additional connection waveguides, shows that the calculated RF losses match the observations. However, the only increase of the dielectric loss is not sufficient to explain the high temperatures measured with infrared camera. The higher temperature and delay time is explained by a thermal barrier due to ceramic metallization and the use of low thermal conduction brazing materials. 

 
This work shows that large margins must be taken from the reference design (or alternatively accept large production wastes), especially in cases where mechanical stresses are close to acceptable margins. It is believed that improvements in the manufacturing (in particular the brazing of the ceramic) and in the water cooling circuit are necessary to achieve the target performances.

\end{marginfigure}

RF contacts are used to ease the assembling and/or sliding movements of the structures and to lower the thermo-mechanical stress, while insuring the continuity of the RF current (Figure~\ref{fig:rfcontactpurpose}). Depending on the purpose, these sliding contacts can be located into a pressurized or a vacuum environment. Although RF contacts are commonly used in the electronic industry as well as on scientific research facilities, however, their application on high RF current load under vacuum is very limited.

\end{marginfigure}


Specific RF contacts have been developed specifically for particle accelerators \sidecite{calatroni2001} or in nuclear fusion research at RF frequencies  \sidecite{agarici1997, ladurelle1997}. During the last 15 years, such contacts have been tested in various operating conditions. CEA or IPP internal or EFDA-funded studies have been made for antenna R\&D like for the JET-EP antenna or for W7-X \sidecite{birus2005}, as well as in RF accelerators \sidecite{waites1998, calatroni2001}. Standard commercial products Multi-Contact LA-CUT are for instance used inside the JET "ITER-like" antenna between the capacitors and the straps \sidecite{goulding2003}. The experiments results obtained at CEA under vacuum with these commercial contacts are summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:rfcontactsummaryexperiments}.

The ITER Ion Cyclotron Resonance Heating and Current Drive (ICRH\&CD) system is designed to couple to the plasma 20~MW (10~MW each from two antennas) of RF power in the 40-55~MHz frequency range in continuous wave operation (3600~s) \sidecite{beaumont2013, lamalle2013, durodie2014}. The RF power, generated by nine 3~MW sources (four per antenna and one spare), is carried though pressurized coaxial lines to 8 feeds per antenna. The ITER ICRH antenna design relies on electrical sliding contacts located in a few locations of the antenna on both inner and outer conductors\footnote{The design of the ITER ICRH antenna has been completely updated from 2019, in order to simplify its mechanical structure. In this new design, the number (and location) of the RF-contact have reduced.} \sidecite{argouarch2014, hillairet2015-1}. These contacts ensure the current continuity and allow the antenna assembly by lowering thermo-mechanical stresses of the Removable Vacuum Transmission Line (RVTL) coaxial conductors during the RF operations. They are required to be used in steady-state conditions and under the machine high vacuum ($ 10^{-3}$ - $10^{-7}$~\si{Pa}). The temperature environment of the contacts depends on the machine regime: during RF operations, the antenna in which the contacts are located is cooled by a 70–90$\si{\degreeCelsius}$ water network while during baking operations (no RF) the temperature rises to 250$\si{\degreeCelsius}$. These RF contacts have to withstand maximum peak current of 2.5~kA in steady-state at 40-55~MHz, on various diameters. In terms of current densities, defined as the ratio between the current and the circumference of the contact strip, this represents between 3.1~kA/m and 4.8~kA/m depending on their location in the antenna. The highest current density corresponds to the inner conductor connection between the 4-ports junction and the RVTL for a 2~kA peak current on a 132~mm diameter at 55~MHz. The thermal expansion during RF operation on a RVTL is estimated to 2~mm, at low speed (~0.05~mm/s). During assembly or intervention, the total stroke is about 50 mm at the remote handling system speed (few \si{mm/s}) and under atmosphere. Since no routine maintenances are scheduled on the antenna, these contacts must operate during its whole lifetime, required to be at least 20 years. Thus, the reliability of the ICRH antenna is directly linked to these contacts, which have to withstand 30~000 cycles over this period. For this reason, the contact design and materials require extensive characterizations.

In a previous test campaign, a design proposed by the CYCLE consortium using brazed lamellae supported by a spring \cite{argouarch2014}, was tested in the T-resonator up to 1.7~kA during 1200~s but failed for larger current values due to a degradation of the contacts as illustrated in Figures\ref{fig:rfcontactccfebefore} and \ref{fig:rfcontactccfe}\cite{hillairet2015-1}. During previous tests on the T-resonator or in other testing devices, higher current densities have been reached when using commercial contacts such as Multi-Contact LA-CUT\cite{argouarch2013}. For this reason, the tests realized in 2014 were made using such kinds of commercial product. These T-resonator is described in next section and the tests made in 2014 are described in the following sections.

\subsubsection{The CEA/IRFM T-resonator}

\begin{marginfigure}

	\caption{Illustration of the CEA/IRFM T-resonator.}
	\label{fig:rfcontacttresonatorillustration2}
\end{figure}

CEA had setup a steady-state test bed, an actively water-cooled coaxial T-resonator illustrated in Figures~\ref{fig:rfcontacttresonatorillustration2} and \ref{fig:rfcontacttresonator2}, which allows testing coaxial components up to 45~kV and 2.25~kA in ITER relevant conditions of vacuum and temperature \sidecite{argouarch2013}. The setup consists in a rigid coaxial resonator, made of two main branches approximatively 2.2~meters long. Both branches are RF powered from a RF source feeding a T-junction and are ended by adjustable short-circuits referred as \textit{trolleys} hereafter. Such sliding short-circuits allow tuning the resonator matching configuration, in addition to the possibility to tune the RF input power frequency. A vacuum feed-through is located upstream of the T-junction, which allows the T-resonator to be vacuum pumped. Electric heating cables were inserted into both branches outer conductors for baking purposes. 

All the inner and outer conductors of the resonator are actively water cooled by a cold water loop (4 bar/20\degC). The resonator, located in the TITAN facility, can also be connected to a hot water loop compatible with ITER specifications (up to 44~bar/250\degC). The water cooling temperature during RF operations in the ITER IC antenna is estimated to be 90\degC at the contact location. The DUT branch is optimized to maximize the current at the short-circuit. The current density at the outer conductor is approximatively half of the current density at the inner conductor (128/219=0.58). A similar setup is used on the opposite branch, with a reduced current at the short circuit due to the branch characteristic impedance configuration.

In order to match the resonator, both short circuit lengths can be tuned as well as the generator RF frequency, which allows a large operational flexibility. Voltage is measured in two locations of the resonator using voltage probes similar to the ones used in the JET and Tore Supra/WEST ICRH antennas \sidecite{helou2016}. The current at the short circuits is deduced from the measured voltages using a RF model of the resonator. To do this, both a lump\sidenote{The lump model is \href{https://github.com/jhillairet/tresonator}{available online}.} and a full-wave model in ANSYS HFSS and Designer have been created. These models parameters are the two short-circuit distances and the two equivalent resistances presented by each short circuits. Moreover, the material conductivities given in literature tables are given for bulk materials and are generally optimistic when dealing with surface coatings (Cf. the Section~\ref{sec:RF_windows} on the LHCD RF window R\&D). Thus, the Ohmic losses in the resonator model need also to be slightly increased to match reality, by a coefficient to be determined from the $Q$-factor measurement. In order to deduce all these quantities, first a low power measurement is performed on the matched resonator. The lump model short resistances and propagation losses are then optimized in order to match the measurements. 

An example of the result of the optimization is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:rfcontacttresonators11} where the transmission line model fits perfectly the measurements for equivalent resistances of 3.4 and 6.8~mΩ for the DUT and CEA short circuits respectively and additional propagation losses of +4.6\%. In this case, the resonator has been matched around 62~MHz. The choice of a frequency higher than the ITER bandwidth aims to maximize the RF losses and thus providing an additional engineering safety margin.

	\label{fig:rfcontacttresonators11}
\end{figure}


Once the short circuit resistances are known, the model can determine the voltage and the current everywhere in the resonator for a given input power and short-circuit lengths. Figure~\ref{fig:rfcontacttresonatorcurrentvoltage} illustrates the voltage and current distribution for an input RF power of 60~kW. A maximum voltage of 40~kV is reached in the CEA branch while a maximum current of 2~kA is reached at the DUT short circuit.

\subsubsection{Contact Materials}
\paragraph{Base Materials}

\begin{marginfigure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{figures/chap3/RF_contacts/RF_contact_materials}
	\caption{Illustration of the contact materials.}
	\label{fig:rfcontactmaterials}
\end{marginfigure}

Two types of base materials are relevant in the context of RF contact on ITER ICRH antenna: i) the contact louvers material (bulk) and ii) the base material of the facing conductor (Figure~\ref{fig:rfcontactmaterials}). For the facing conductors (or the contact holder), common materials are stainless steel and copper alloys. Stainless-steel has good mechanical strength and is a common material for manufacturing but its main drawback is its high electrical and thermal resistivity. In order to increase both the electrical and thermal conductivity, CuCrZr alloy is a good structural material commonly used in fusion engineering \sidecite{lipa2005, barabash2011} . 

\begin{marginfigure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{figures/chap3/RF_contacts/RF_contact_creeping}
	\caption{Illustration of the creeping consequence.}
	\label{fig:rfcontactcreeping}
\end{marginfigure}

On the shelf LA-CUT louvers are made of either copper or copper-beryllium. However, copper is known to seriously creep in high temperature conditions (Figure~\ref{fig:rfcontactcreeping}), for instance during the thousands of hours of ITER baking phases at 250\degC. Since creeping would impact the contact pressure applied to the conductor and degrade the contact quality with time \sidecite{pauer2002}, pure copper louvers must be discarded. Copper-beryllium (CuBe), copper-nickel-beryllium (CuNiBe) and copper-chromium-zirconium (CuCrZr) alloys have lower creep rate as well as higher yield strength \sidecite{li2000, li2012}. The material properties of these alloys highly depends on their manufacturers and grades, but in a general way the yield strength of CuBe (>700~MPa) is higher than CuCrZr (around 450~MPa) and its thermal conductivity is lower (from 50 to 200 versus 320-340~\si{W/m.K}) \cite{li2012}. In addition, in a fusion reactor, high energy neutrons will produce Ni, Zn and smaller amount of Cobalt in copper and copper alloys, producing a significant decrease of the electrical and thermal conductivity  \sidecite{ garner1998, eichin2004}. At the contrary of CuCrZr, CuBe and CuNiBe contains Nickel (between 1.4 to 2.2\%) and Cobalt (between 0.30 to 0.60\%), which may induce higher intensity gamma-ray emitter 60Co after neutron irradiation. Depending of the total amount of these products, CuCrZr may be preferred to CuBe/CuNiBe in this context. Moreover, because of low fracture toughness and tensile elongations for temperatures higher than 250$\si{\degreeCelsius}$, CuNiBe appears to be not a suitable option unless improved thermo-mechanical treatment conditions are found \sidecite{zinkle2014}. For the latter reasons, the choice of a CuCrZr alloy for the contact louvers material has been made.

\paragraph{Coating Materials}
Early current connector designs implementing metal-metal contacts were plagued with high friction, wear and heat generation mainly attributed to electrochemical oxidation and arcing \sidecite{Argibay2011, argibay2012}. For the electrical contacts working at high temperature and high vacuum, wear performance becomes critical and coatings can be used to improve their electrical performance and life-time. For RF applications, dozens of micrometers thicknesses are enough for contact materials, which is much lower than their required structural dimensions. Moreover, the geometry of the RF contact is usually complex and good uniformity of coating is required for the whole RF contact component. For these reasons, electroplating is generally used for RF contact coating.  
The ideal vacuum electrical contact coating materials should have the following characterizations: high electrical conductivity, high thermal conductivity and good structural stability under high temperature, low friction coefficient and high wear resistance even under high temperature and high vacuum and if possible economic. It is difficult to find a material to meet all the above requirements, which are sometimes antagonistic. Compared with single electro-deposited metals, alloy deposition often provides superior properties. With certain composition ranges, the alloy electroplating layers can be harder, denser and have higher resistance to corrosion and wear. 

Silver is a well-used contact material, since it has the highest electrical and thermal conductivity of all metals (resistivity: 1.67~$\si{\micro \ohm cm}$) and is also resistant against oxidation. Electroplated silver is a worthy coating for temperatures less than 160$\si{\degreeCelsius}$ with good fretting performance and excellent electrical properties \sidecite{slade2014, talgner2014}. At temperatures higher than 100$\si{\degreeCelsius}$, recrystallization at temperature decreases the hardness to lower than 90~HV10, which can induce wear, cold welding and material migration. Coating thicknesses up to few tens of micrometers are generally deposited on the electrical contacts designed to withstand very high normal force (10-100~N), which is the case in this application. For these reasons, a thick silver-coating (>10$\si{\mu m}$) has been selected as a functional coating of the RF contact louvers.

\subsubsection{Sliding Tests}
\begin{marginfigure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{figures/chap3/RF_contacts/RF_contact_LACUT_sliding_tests}
	\caption{Picture of the insertion and sliding test bed at CEA (Maestral, Pierrelatte)}
	\label{fig:rfcontactlacutslidingtests}
\end{marginfigure}

The contact prototype has been assembled into a static electromechanical load frame illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:rfcontactlacutslidingtests}. The load frame was moved through an oven that can be baked to the required temperature, which is controlled with a precision of +/- 0.5$\si{\degreeCelsius}$. The force cell located on the top of the load frame is cooled by water and forced air to allow a stable temperature during the test. The sliding contacts (95 louvers) have been inserted in a steel holder (the male part) which can be inserted in a CuCrZr ring (the female counterpart). A diaphragm bellows is assembled between both parts and the assembly can be vacuum-pumped via a turbo-molecular pump. Centring brass elements were added to the setup in order to improve the coaxial alignment between male and female parts. The position accuracy of the male part is measured within +/- 0.5\% and the load is measured with a 5~kN force cell. 


The load frame was first used to measure the required insertion forces under atmosphere, then the sliding forces in an ITER relevant vacuum and 175$\si{\degreeCelsius}$ environment, which corresponds to an estimate of the operational temperature of the contacts. Up to 30 000 cycles with a 3~mm stroke were performed in vacuum at 175$\si{\degreeCelsius}$. The required insertion force up to approximatively 700~N for the first insertion and about 550~N the following insertions, which corresponds to 5.8~N per louver. When the contact is fully engaged, the sliding force is about 200~N (2.1~N per louver). After 10 cycles, a thin layer of silver is transferred from the louvers to the CuCrZr ring. 

Then, the test bed was pumped and baked to 175$\si{\degreeCelsius}$ with a brand new Multi-Contact band with 95 louvers assembled in the test bed. The measured pressure at 175$\si{\degreeCelsius}$ is $3.2\times 10^{-4}$~Pa. 5~000 cycles were made on an extension of 3~mm (1.5~mm back and 1.5~mm forth). The Figure~\ref{fig:rfcontactlacutslidingtestsresults} illustrates the load vs the cumulated distance travelled by the contact during these 5~000 cycles. It can be seen that the load is increasing then sharply decreasing over the cumulated distance of one meter, corresponding to the first 200-300 cycles. After one meter (>300 cycles), the load is almost constant and on the order of 250 N.


\begin{marginfigure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{figures/chap3/RF_contacts/RF_contact_LACUT_sliding_tests_results_15000}
	\caption{Close-up picture of some louvers after 5 000 and 15 000 sliding strokes. The CuCrZr louvers are little damaged. The silver coating has been removed from the louver's tip. Results are similar after 30 000 cycles.}
	\label{fig:rfcontactlacutslidingtestsresults15000}
\end{marginfigure}

After 5 000 cycles, the test bed was opened and inspected. The silver coating of the contact is totally removed at the tip of the louvers (Figure~\ref{fig:rfcontactlacutslidingtestsresults15000}). Clear scratches are visible on the CuCrZr ring, and a detailed observation of the contact shows the removal of the silver layer on the tip of louver. The area of contact (1800x900µm) after 5 000 cycles is flattened and the CuCrZr base is clearly visible. From the curves of the Figure~\ref{fig:rfcontactlacutslidingtestsresults}, three sliding regimes can be identified. During the first tens of cycles, the sliding force magnitude increases. This increase is inferred to the machining of the silver (on the louvers) and the CuCrZr (on the ring), where the softer silver forms an interfacial layer (‘buttering’). Once the silver coating fully removed in the sliding track, the abrasion of the louver tip leads to a smaller compression (by consequence the LA-CUT stainless-steel elastic skeleton is less constrained) which tends to decrease the contact force. At a certain point, an established regime is achieved (CuCrZr louvers vs CuCrZr ring).  

Subsequent series of 10 000 and 15 000 cycles were made with the same contact band up to a total of 30 000 cycles (90 meters), corresponding to the required operational life of the ICRH antenna in ITER. For each series, the mechanical position of the contact stabilized in a few cycles and then the average load remained almost constant to 250 and 300~N during the remainder of the cycles. The wear on the louvers after 30~000 cycles is of the order of 150~µm (Figure\ref{fig:rfcontactlacutlouvertip}, top picture). The wear of the CuCrZr ring after 30 000 cycles (90 meters) is of the order of 60-80 µm on a width of 0.1~mm (Figure\ref{fig:rfcontactlacutlouvertip}, bottom picture). The remaining question of the impact of such scratches on the RF current flow has not been investigated and could be investigated by performing RF tests with the damaged contacts.

\end{figure}

The main outcome of these sliding tests is the rapid wearing of the thick silver coating. The 30~µm silver-coating made on the LA-CUT louvers is removed during approximately a hundred of stroke cycles made at 175\degC under vacuum, which represents a cumulated distance travelled lower than one meter. Once this layer removed, we end up with a friction between the CuCrZr of the louver and the material facing the louver, the CuCrZr of the ring in this case. 

\subsubsection{RF Tests}
A new qualification campaign has been setup in 2015-2016 in order to test a new Multi-Contact LA-CUT prototype made of 30~µm silver coated CuCrZr louvers (Figure~\ref{fig:rfcontactlacuttest}). This prototype has also been assembled into the RF resonator in order to test it under ITER relevant conditions. 

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{figures/chap3/RF_contacts/RF_contact_LACUT_test}
	\caption{LA-CUT setup before assembly into the RF resonator}
	\label{fig:rfcontactlacuttest}
\end{figure}

In order to reproduce the ITER conditions, the Device-Under-Test (DUT) is assembled on a copper coated stainless-steel holder, ending the inner conductor of the DUT branch. Both this inner conductor extension and the trolley have been connected to the hot water cooling loop, tuned to a 90\degC inlet temperature. Prior to RF tests, the resonator has been pumped and baked up to 120\degC during 20 days. After baking, the pressure was $8\times10^{-6}$~Pa. During RF tests, the resonator was water cooled at 20-25\degC while the DUT was water cooled at 90\degC to mimic ITER operations. RF conditioning shots consisting in kilowatt range of power pulses were performed for a set of various frequencies around the match frequency, in order to sweep the voltage and current node locations in the resonator. 

Once conditioning pulses do not reflect power at the match frequency, the input power has been progressively increased during short durations. Within 90 shots, the target current specification of 2.25~kA has been reached during 100~ms, then up to 5~s by increasing duration steps. The current was progressively increased in both amplitude and shot duration. During RF shot, the pressure was monitored for outgassing, but this time we allowed larger increases of the pressure, keeping an automatic safety interlock ($2\times10^{-2}$~Pa). It was found that the pressure increased after few tens of seconds, sometimes up to $10^{-2}$~Pa, but then stabilized and then decreased during the RF shot. Thus, the current was increased to 1.2~kA during up to 1200~s without pressure increase larger than the safety interlock. Light emission was continuously monitored during these shots, starting after 60 to 120~s depending on the shot. Moreover, it was observed that the light emission changed both in brightness (increase or decrease) and locations during the shot duration as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:rfcontactlacutlightemission}.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{figures/chap3/RF_contacts/RF_contact_LACUT_light_emission}
	\caption{Webcam snapshots during shot \#3379 (1.2kA/1200s).}
	\label{fig:rfcontactlacutlightemission}
\end{figure}

At this point and for higher RF power, it was observed that the number of arc events detected (from reflected power) increased, sometimes led to the complete un-matching of the resonator, often at the beginning of the pulse but even after hundreds of seconds of RF power. In order to reduce these effects, the input power was then ramped up instead of applying the full power from the beginning of the RF pulse. Using this strategy, the current has been increased up to 1.9~kA during 300~s. After this last pulse, outgassing increased up to $8\times 10^{-2}$~Pa during the cool down of the DUT and the resonator was detuned. Outgassing was severe for the following shots and it was not possible to continue RF tests. The inspection of the DUT side of the resonator showed that the DUT contact louvers were burned and melted in various places, and burn/arc traces were also observed on the trolley contact louvers (Figure~\ref{fig:rfcontactlacutmelt}). 


\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{figures/chap3/RF_contacts/RF_contact_LACUT_melt}
	\caption{Pictures of the RF contacts after failure. Left picture: inner conductor DUT contact holder. Right picture: outer conductor contacts on sliding trolley.}
	\label{fig:rfcontactlacutmelt}
\end{figure}

The target performance, i.e. a peak current of 2.25~kA at 62~MHz, has been reached only on short pulses duration (below 10~s). Currents between 1.2~kA and 1.3~kA have been reached in steady-state conditions (with duration higher than 60~s up to 1200~s) without any problem monitored on RF or pressure sensors. An inspection of the contacts has been performed after having reached currents lower than 1.3~kA and do not show any visual damage. The RF current has been increased up to a maximum of 1.9~kA during 300~s, but it was not possible to increase the current to larger values. The targeted steady-state RF tests specifications on the contact have not been achieved, due to the failure of the contacts at lower current values (1.9~kA). 

From RF and thermal modelling of the contact, the following failure mechanism is proposed. Because of its relatively low electrical conductivity, high RF losses are deposited at the surface of the contact steel spring elements. Since the heat accumulated in this steel part is poorly evacuated in the present design, its temperature increases which reduces its stiffness. As the contact force between the louvers and the fix part decreases accordingly, the contact resistance at the louver tips increases, leading to a vicious circle increasing the heat flux on the louvers up to melt some CuCrZr louvers. As the number of louvers in contact with the fix part decrease, the current is diverted to the remaining louvers, thus increasing again the heat fluxes and finally lead to the failure of all louvers in cascade. 



\subsubsection{Failure Mechanisms and Material R\&D}
Even though significant progress about the mechanical design of RF sliding contacts and the necessary knowledge about their material had been achieved in the previous R\&D phases, there is still a large gap between the obtained results and the ITER RF sliding contact design specifications. The development of an ITER RF sliding contact is the combination of mechanical structure design and material selection. The previous studies mainly focused on the RF current carrying capability of the LA-CUT commercial product. However, the failure mechanism of the RF contact was not deeply researched. As a result, the main parameters or factors that can affect the RF contact's stability were not clearly understood. In the PhD thesis of Zhaoxi Chen\sidecite{chen2018}, the failure mechanisms of the LA-CUT commercial electrical contact under ITER ICRH application conditions have been deeply investigated and relationship between the LA-CUT operational performance with the material selection have been analyzed. Direction to the material selection for the ITER ICRH RF sliding contact development have also been given. 

\begin{marginfigure}

	\caption{The contact resistance between two metal of respective resistivity $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$ is defined by $$R_c=\frac{\rho_1+\rho_2}{4a}$$ where $a$ is the average radius of the metal-to-metal contact area\cite{holm2011}.}
	\label{fig:rfcontactrc}
\end{marginfigure}

From FEM models and by performing electrical-thermal and thermal-hydraulic analyses, Zhaoxi Chen analysed the failure mechanisms of ITER RF sliding contacts based on a prototype of the Multi-Contact LA-CUT product \sidecite{chen2017-2}. Using the results of the test campaign described in previous sections, it was found that the steady-state operating temperature of the RF contact louver linearly increases with the contact resistance ($R_c$) increase (Figure~\ref{fig:rfcontactrc}). In order to maintain the temperature of the RF contact louver below 250\degC, it has been calculated that the $R_c$ should be lower than 6.5~$\si{\milli\ohm}$/louver. This parameter drives the choice of the materials to be used to reduce the operational contact louver temperature. If the RF conductor is made of 316L stainless steel, increasing cooling parameters (such as mass flow rate and velocity) has almost no effect to improve the cooling performance of the contact louver. Actively cooled CuCrZr is strongly suggested as base material of the RF contacts support. 

During his PhD, Zhaoxi Chen developped a multi-functional tribometer \sidecite{chen2017-3} which can mimic ITER-relevant vacuum and temperature conditions for material evaluation for the ITER RF sliding contact (Figure~\ref{fig:rfcontacttribometerzhaoxi}). Although some commercial vacuum tribometers which could even perform contact resistances exist, no tribometer were found having in addition a sample heating capability. Moreover, any commercial vacuum tribometer needs to be opened to adjust the normal contact force, which is time-consuming and not compatible with the time allowed for the material study in this thesis, as we needed to adjust the normal contact force frequently. Thus, a multi-functional tribometer which can mimic the ITER environment conditions and be operated conveniently and reliably was developed. This tribometer then been used to characterize the friction and contact resistance properties of various samples of materials. A French innovation patent concerning the loading system has been submitted and authorized\sidecite{chen2017-4}.

	\caption{Illustration of the vacuum tribometer develloped in the frame of the PhD thesis of Zhaoxi Chen\cite{chen2018}}
	\label{fig:rfcontacttribometerzhaoxi}
\end{figure}

The feasibility of applying Au-Ni, Ag, Ag-Sb and Rh as functional coatings for ITER RF sliding contacts have been evaluated from material characterizations and the tribometer developped (Figure~\ref{fig:rfcontacttribometerresults}) \sidecite{chen2017-2, chen2018}. The base material of the RF contact louvers was selected as CuCrZr. The supporting conductor can be made of 316L or CuCrZr. From FEM analyses, the $R_c$ of one louver should be lower than 6.5~$\si{\milli\ohm}$. In order to improve the electrical and tribological performances of the sliding contact, the application of functional coatings have been found to be mandatory. From the commonly used material in the electrical industry, the specific ITER environment conditions of vacuum and temperature lead to the choice of Au-Ni, Ag, Ag-Sb and Rh coatings.

	\caption{Example of measurement of contact resistance $R_C$ in vacuum conditions in the tribometer. }
	\label{fig:rfcontacttribometerresults}
\end{figure}

In addition, the development of Au-Ni/a-C and Au-Co/WS2 composite coatings and their application as electrical functional coatings in ITER has been investigated \sidecite{chen2020}. Although Au-Ni and Au-Co are commonly used coatings on electrical and electronic industries, their composite coatings were not deeply considered in the fusion research field. As seen with sliding tests, ITER ICRH RF sliding contacts will face severe adhesive wear during operation and applying solid lubricants on them is very promising. Satisfactory Au-Ni/a-C composite coatings were deposited by magnetron sputtering. A significant hardness improvement has been demonstrated in comparison with Au-Ni coating. However, due to the low lubricating efficiency of carbon materials in vacuum, these composite coatings do not have advantages in minimizing friction coefficient and wear rate compared with Au-Ni coating. Finally, An Au-Co/WS2 electroplating composite coatings process has been developed and used. A technical breakthrough was made in the WS2 particle dispersion in aqueous cyanide electrolyte\cite{chen2020}. Their high efficiency in minimizing friction and wear rate under ITER conditions were proved. 

Before this thesis, no systematic study and evaluation of common functional coatings under ITER relevant conditions have been made. During this thesis, the above functional coatings were electro-deposited on CuCrZr and 316L substrates and they were deeply characterized regarding their diffusion phenomena with their substrates or with another coating after 250\degC thermal aging process. In addition, thermal aging effects on the coatings'morphology, hardness, adhesion performance, crystal structure, electrical and tribological performances were evaluated. The coefficient of friction and contact resistance $R_c$ values have also been measured. All these results provide a good reference for the future studies of ITER RF sliding contacts or other projects.


\subsubsection{Summary of this section}

Radio-Frequency tests have been performed at CEA/IRFM using a RF resonator equipped with Multi-Contact LA-CUT/0.25/0 prototype, which louvers are made in CuCrZr with a 32~µm thick silver coating. From ITER IC antenna specifications, the targeted test specifications were a peak current of 2.25~kA during 20~minutes (1200~s), under vacuum pressure below $10^{-3}$~Pa and a water cooling temperature of 90\degC $\pm$ 5\degC at a RF frequency of 62~MHz. The required current performance has been reached on durations inferior to 60~s. Currents between 1.2~kA and 1.3~kA have been reached in steady-state conditions, for durations larger than 60~s and up to 1200~s, without any problem monitored on RF or pressure sensors, despite monitoring light emission. The RF current has been increased up to a maximum of 1.9~kA during 300~s, but it was not possible to increase the current to larger values. The targeted steady-state RF tests specifications on the contact have not been achieved, due to the failure of the contacts for which both the CuCrZr louvers and the steel holder of the contact band melted in various locations. 

Sliding tests have shown that the coating located at the tip of the louver barely survives to more than hundreds of sliding cycles, the reason of existence these coatings could be challenged in regard of the number of the sliding cycles expected in the antenna. However, one should keep in mind that since most of the louver coating is not damaged during sliding, the gain in heat losses reduction is still important. Moreover, the Ag coating protects the CuCrZr substrate from corrosion. A remaining question is the impact of the louver tips silver-coating removal and of the generated scratches on the ring surface on the RF performances. This point could be investigated by performing RF tests with damaged contacts. Finally, in order to increase the life time of the louver coating, advanced coating made of silver or gold alloys with increased hardness could be investigated.

A dedicated PhD oriented on material science has been setup with the Toulouse University in order to analyse the failure mechanisms of these RF contacts\sidecite{chen2018}. During this thesis, a vacuum tribometer has been designed and used to measure the material characteristic in vacuum environment. In combination to FEM analysis, the conclusions of this work are that material selection is the main driver of the both RF and thermal performances of these RF contacts, in particular when used under vacuum environment. The bulk and coating materials must selected in order to optimize mechanical and RF performances. From this analysis, a new set of test with improved RF contacts and choice of coatings and bulk materials will be made at CEA/IRFM in 2021.

Magnetic Fusion RF antennas are generally made of copper or silver-coated stainless steels located in vacuum environments. The vacuum sealing with pressurized transmission lines is made with the help of ceramics such as alumina, aluminium nitride, beryllium oxide or diamond. 

All these components are subject to multipactor discharges which increases the electron population (via secondary emission and gas desorption) which in turn may ultimately lead to an avalanche effect and the development of a discharge even at pressures two order of magnitude below Paschen breakdown limit\sidecite{graves2006}. These discharges are generally considered detrimental since they can lead to detuned RF systems, limit the RF power transmission in the plasma and eventually damage RF sources or components. When not detected quickly enough, arcs can lead to surface erosion \sidecite[-0.4cm]{goniche2012-2}, dielectric components metallisation \sidecite{wang2015} or water/air leaks due to punctured components such as bellows \sidecite{mayoral2007} or vacuum windows \sidecite{neuber1998, neuber2007, hillairet2015}. 

In some cases however, multipactor-induced discharges can be desired for vacuum RF conditioning during short RF pulses and at moderate power\sidecite{goniche2012-2, wang2015, halbritter1982, ekedahl1998}. Moreover, these RF systems are subjected to the high magnetic field environment of the experiments in the Tesla range. The presence of magnetic field affects the electron trajectories and thus the multipactor resonances. On tokamaks, the electron motion is strongly constrained around the magnetic field lines which reduce the effects of loss mechanisms such as diffusion and increases electron impact ionization and thus the build-up of glow discharges. Finally, at the difference of RF payloads in satellite, the antenna surfaces can be polluted during operation with particles resulting from the strong interaction of the energetic particles with the walls of the tokamak, which may alter the surface characteristics such as secondary emission. This paper reviews the work performed in the fusion research community on multipactor discharges for two kinds of RF systems with their practical implications on power delivery into the plasma. The Ion Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ICRH), which uses coaxial lines in the MHz range of frequency, is presented in the next section. The Lower Hybrid Current Drive (LHCD) systems, which uses rectangular waveguides in the GHz range of frequency is discussed in section 3.
