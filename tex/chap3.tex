The purpose of RF engineering for plasma heating and current drive is to transmit several MW of RF power at frequencies from the MHz to GHz range and to deliver it into the plasma with the highest net efficiency as possible. The RF power is generated by one or few RF generators, then eventually combined and transported to the antennas. In order to optimize the global efficiency, it is desirable to have low loss, high electrical efficiency, low reflections, high reliability and actuators to adjust amplitude and phase. 

This chapter review the work done on high power RF devices at CEA/IRFM. The first section (\ref{sec:RF_fundamentals}) is a reminder of the essential elements of RF engineering and readers aware of the transmission line and electromagnetic networks can skip this section. 
ICRH and LHCD high power transmission line elements are detailed in section \ref{sec:RF_components} while the section \ref{sec:RF_antennas} is dedicated to the antenna designs. Since RF breakdowns are a recurrent problematic in high RF power applications, the section~\ref{sec:Multipactor} is fully dedicated to this topic, in particular to the multipactor phenomenon which occurs in vacuum environments.

\subsection{Uniform Transmission lines Properties}
\marginnote[*-2]{Part of this section are taken from the documentation of the open-source Python package \href{http://scikit-rf.org/}{scikit-rf} which is developed by the author and used in RF circuit models, for example in \citeauthyear{hillairet2015-2} or in \citeauthyear{hillairet2019-1}.}

Once RF waves have been generated, it must be transmitted to the antennas, using suitable transmission line depending on the RF frequency and power level. The main results and properties of uniform transmission lines are reviewed in this section. The results given here are well-known and can be found in numerous textbooks such as \sidecite{Harrington2001, marcuvitz1951, Thourel1988, Collin1990, gonzalez1997, pozar2012, Orfanidis, steer2019-3} to give a personal selection.

A transmission line is defined as \textit{uniform} if its dimensions and electrical properties are identical for all planes transverse to the direction of propagation. The results listed in this section are used in the following sections of this chapter for the design and the analysis of high power RF components.

\subsubsection{Voltage and Current}

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/chap3/transmission_line_properties_vi}
	\caption{A transmission line terminated in a load impedance $Z_L$.}
	\label{fig:transmissionlinepropertiesvi}
\end{figure}

Let a lossy transmission line of propagation constant $\gamma=\alpha+j\beta$ (in $\si{m^{-1}}$) and characteristic impedance $Z_0$ (in $\si{\Omega}$), terminated by an arbitrary load $Z_L$. The line length is The source is parametrized by the distance $z$, where the source is located at distance $z=-d$ from the load ($z=0$) as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:transmissionlinepropertiesvi}. Attenuation constant $\alpha$ has the units of Nepers per meter $\si{Np/m}$ and the phase constant $\beta$ has the units radians per meter $\si{rad/m}$\footnote{$1\,\si{Np/m}$ equals to $8.6859 \, \si{dB/m}$. To convert from \si{dB} to \si{Np} multiply by $0.1151$. Thus $\alpha = x \, \si{dB/m} = x \times 0.1151 \, \si{Np/m}$.}. Let $V=V(z)$ and $I=I(z)$ the total voltage and current on the line, which can be written as a sum of a forward and reflected waves:
\marginnote{$\Vfwd$ and $\Vrefl$ ($\Ifwd$ and $\Irefl$) are defined here as peak voltages (currents). For sine wave, RMS voltage is $V_{\mathrm{RMS}}=V_{\mathrm{peak}}/\sqrt{2}$.}
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
	V(z) = \Vfwd(z) + \Vrefl(z) =& \Vfwd e^{-\gamma z} + \Vrefl e^{+\gamma z} \\
	I(z) = \Ifwd(z) + \Irefl(z) =& \frac{\Vfwd}{Z_0} e^{-\gamma z} - \frac{\Vrefl}{Z_0} e^{+\gamma z}
\end{align}
	\label{eq:voltage_current_lossy_line}
\end{subequations}
where the $e^{-\gamma z}$ term represents wave propagation in the $+z$ direction (and $e^{+\gamma z}$ in the $-z$ direction). The terms $\Vfwd$, $\Vrefl$ ($\Ifwd$, $\Irefl$) represent the forward and reflected voltage (current) waves at $z=0$.  
The \textit{characteristic impedance} $Z_0$ associated to a uniform transmission line (or any continuous media supporting the propagation of electromagnetic waves) is defined as the ratio of the forward voltage and current when the transmission line is infinite, i.e.  $Z_0=\Vfwd/\Ifwd(=-\Vrefl/\Irefl)$. It characterizes the property of the line to oppose a change in voltage for a change of current or vice-versa. When $Z_L=Z_0$, the load is said to be \textit{matched} to the line and there is no reflected wave $\Vrefl=0$.

\begin{marginfigure}[-2cm]
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/chap3/transmission_line_transfer}
	\caption{Propagation of current and voltage in a piece of uniform transmission line.}
	\label{fig:transmission_line_transfer}
\end{marginfigure}

The voltage and current at the input ($z=-d$) of a piece of uniform transmission line can be related to the voltage and current at its output (chosen at $z=0$) using the transfer matrix \sidecite{vittoria1998}:
\begin{equation}
\left( 
\begin{array}{c}
	V_{\mathrm{in}} \\
	I_{\mathrm{in}}
\end{array}
\right)
=
\left( 
\begin{array}{cc}
\cosh  \left(\gamma d\right) & Z_0 \sinh \left(\gamma d \right) \\ 
\frac{1}{Z_0}\sinh \left( \gamma d\right) & \cosh\left(\gamma d\right) 
\end{array} 
\right)
\left( 
\begin{array}{c}
	V_{\mathrm{out}} \\
	I_{\mathrm{out}}
\end{array}
\right)
	\label{eq:voltage_current_transfer_matrix}
\end{equation}




% #####################################################
\subsubsection{Reflection Coefficient}
The ratio of the reflected to forward voltage (or current) at a distance $z$ defines the \textit{reflection coefficient} $\Gamma$:
\marginnote{\textit{Return loss} RL is the negative of the magnitude of the reflection coefficient in \si{dB}. Since power is proportional to the square of the voltage, return loss is given by $$\mathrm{RL} = -20 \log_{10} |\Gamma|$$
The \textit{transmission coefficient} can be also defined as $$T=1+\Gamma$$
 sometime expressed as the \textit{insertion loss} IL in \si{dB}:
 $$\mathrm{IL}=-20 \log |T|$$}
\begin{equation}
\Gamma(z) = \frac{\Vrefl(z)}{\Vfwd(z)} =  \frac{\Irefl(z)}{\Ifwd(z)} = \Gamma_L e^{2\gamma z}
\label{eq:Gamma_at_z}
\end{equation}
where $\Gamma_L$ is the reflection coefficient of the load ($z=0$), given by:
\begin{equation}
	\Gamma_L = \frac{Z_L - Z_0}{Z_L + Z_0}
	\label{eq:Gamma_L}
\end{equation}
Note that the reflection coefficient at the input of the line $\Gamma_{\mathrm{in}}$ (Figure~\ref{fig:coaxial_line_fields}) is given for $z=-d$:
$$
\Gamma_{\mathrm{in}}=\Gamma(z=-d)=\Gamma_L e^{-2\gamma d}
$$

In fusion application, the load is unfortunately rarely matched to the transmission line or the source impedances, so it is convenient to re-express voltage and current equations (\ref{eq:voltage_current_lossy_line}) as a function of $\Gamma_L$ (\ref{eq:Gamma_L}) or $\Gamma(z)$ (\ref{eq:Gamma_at_z}):
\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
		V(z) =& \Vfwd \left( e^{-\gamma z} + \Gamma_L e^{+\gamma z} \right) 
			= \Vfwd \left[ 1 + \Gamma(z) \right]  e^{-\gamma z} \\
		I(z) =& \frac{\Vfwd}{Z_0} \left( e^{-\gamma z} - \Gamma_L e^{+\gamma z} \right)
			= \frac{\Vfwd}{Z_0} \left[ 1 - \Gamma_L(z)  \right]e^{-\gamma z}
	\end{align}
	\label{eq:voltage_current_lossy_line_gamma}
\end{subequations} 

The \textit{standing wave ratio} or SWR is defined as:
\marginnote[*-1]{With the inverse expression
	$$ 	|\Gamma| = \frac{\SWR - 1}{\SWR + 1} $$}
\begin{equation}
	\SWR(z) = \frac{1 + |\Gamma(z)|}{1 - |\Gamma(z)|}
	\label{eq:SWR}
\end{equation}
The SWR can be equivalently defined as the ratio of maximum (forward and backward waves are in phase) to minimum (forward and reflected waves are out of phase) voltage magnitudes: 
\begin{equation}
\SWR(z) = \frac{|V_\mathrm{max}(z)|}{|V_\mathrm{min}(z)|} = \frac{|\Vfwd|e^{-\alpha z} + |\Vrefl|e^{+\alpha z}}{|\Vfwd|e^{-\alpha z} - |\Vrefl|e^{+\alpha z}}
\label{eq:SWR_max_to_min_voltages}
\end{equation}
Note that the SWR becomes constant for lossless lines. 


Finally, some special cases are reminded for convenience in the Table~\ref{tab:special_case_loaded_line}.

\begin{table}[h]
	\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
	\hline 
	Case & $\Gamma$ & $\SWR$ \\ 
	\hline 
	Matched: $Z_L = Z_0$ & 0 & 1 \\ 
	\hline 
	Short: $Z_L=0$ & -1 & $\infty$ \\ 
	\hline 
	Open: $Z_L = \infty$ & 1 & $\infty$ \\
	\hline
\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
\caption{Special cases of a uniform loaded transmission line.}
\label{tab:special_case_loaded_line} 
\end{table}


% #####################################################
\subsubsection{Line Impedance}
The impedance seen toward the load at a point of the line, that is the ratio between total voltage and current at this point, is at a distance $z=-\ell$ from the load:
\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
Z(z=-\ell) 
	=& Z_0 \frac{Z_L + Z_0 \tanh( \gamma \ell)}{Z_0 + Z_L \tanh(\gamma \ell)} \\
	=& Z_0 \frac{1 + \Gamma(-\ell) }{1 - \Gamma(-\ell) }
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}
As noted aboved with respect to Figure~\ref{fig:coaxial_line_fields}, we have in particular $Z_{\mathrm{in}}=Z(z=-d)$ and $Z(z=0)=Z_L$.

% #####################################################
\subsubsection{Power and losses}\label{sec:power_and_losses}
The time average power flowing along the transmission line is the difference between the forward and the reflected powers:
\begin{equation}
P (z) = \frac{1}{2} \Re\left[V(z) I^*(z)\right] 
\label{eq:power_time_average_general}
\end{equation}

\marginnote{An example in the \href{https://scikit-rf.readthedocs.io}{scikit-rf package documentation} is dedicated to the evolution of the power, voltage, current and SWR in lossy line. See \cite[§2.7]{pozar2012}, \cite[§2.5.5]{steer2019}, \cite[§3-4c]{Rizzi1988} for discussions of power in lossy terminated line.}

For a lossy transmission line ($\alpha>0$), not all the power entering the transmission line will be delivered to the load as some power will be lost on the line due to attenuation. The time average power at any point of the transmission line (\ref{eq:power_time_average_general}) can be shown to be \sidecite[+1cm]{vernon1969, marks1992}:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align} 
	P(z) =& P_\mathrm{f} - P_\mathrm{r} - P_\mathrm{c} \\
	P_\mathrm{f} =& \Re(Z_0) \frac{|V_\mathrm{f}|^2}{2 |Z_0|^2} e^{-2\alpha z} \\
	P_\mathrm{r} =& \Re(Z_0) \frac{|V_\mathrm{r}|^2}{2 |Z_0|^2} e^{+2\alpha z} = P_\mathrm{f} |\Gamma_L|^2 e^{+4\alpha z} \\
	P_\mathrm{c} =& \Im(Z_0) \Im\left[\frac{\Vrefl\Vfwd^*}{|Z_0|^2} e^{-2j\beta z} \right]
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $P_\mathrm{f}$ and $P_\mathrm{r}$ are the forward and reflected power respectively. In lossy lines, the net power flow $P(z)$ is not in general the difference of the forward and reflected power but carries an additional term $P_\mathrm{c}$. $P_\mathrm{c}$ can be either positive or negative along the line and is null for all $z$ only for a distortion-less line ($\Im(Z_0)=0$). In a word, the superposition of power does not apply in lossy uniform transmission lines (but superposition of voltages and currents does).

Keeping the notation used in Figure~\ref{fig:transmissionlinepropertiesvi} and using equations (\ref{eq:voltage_current_lossy_line_gamma}), the power delivered to the load (at position $z=0$) and at the input of the line (at position $z=-d$) are:
\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
		P_{\mathrm{L}} = P(z=0) =& \Re(Z_0) \frac{\left| \Vfwd \right|^2}{2 |Z_0|^2} \left(1 - |\Gamma_L|^2 \right) \\
		P_{\mathrm{in}} = P(z=-d) =& \Re(Z_0) \frac{\left| \Vfwd \right|^2}{2 |Z_0|^2} \left(1 - |\Gamma_L|^2 e^{-4\alpha d}  \right) e^{2\alpha d}
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}
hence the power lost in the line is:
\marginnote{The total loss $\mathrm{ML}$ in a line in \si{dB} can also be stated as:
$$
 \mathrm{TL}=10\log_{10} \left( \frac{A^2 - |\Gamma_L|^2}{A(1 - |\Gamma_L|^2)} \right)
$$
where $A=10^{\mathrm{ML}/10}$ and $\mathrm{ML}$ the matched line loss. The additional loss caused by the standing waves is the difference between the  $\mathrm{TL}$ and  $\mathrm{ML}$.
}
\begin{equation}
P_{\mathrm{loss}} = P_{\mathrm{in}} - P_{\mathrm{L}} 
= \Re(Z_0)  \frac{\left| \Vfwd \right|^2}{2 |Z_0|^2} 
\left[ 
\left(e^{2\alpha d} - 1\right) + |\Gamma_L|^2 \left( 1 - e^{-2\alpha d} \right)
\right]
\label{eq:power_loss_lossy_transmission_line}
\end{equation}
where the first and second terms in (\ref{eq:power_loss_lossy_transmission_line}) account for the power loss of the forward and reflected waves respectively.
	


For lossless transmission line and real characteristic impedance, the time average power flow along the transmission line is constant and (\ref{eq:power_time_average_general}) simplifies to:
\begin{equation}
P = P_\mathrm{f} - P_\mathrm{r} = P_\mathrm{f} \left(1 - |\Gamma_L|^2\right)
\label{eq:power_loss_lossless_transmission_line}
\end{equation}
This power can also be related to the maximum voltages or currents and $\SWR$ from Eq.(\ref{eq:SWR_max_to_min_voltages}):
\begin{equation}
P = P_\mathrm{f} - P_\mathrm{r} = \frac{1}{2 Z_0} \frac{	|V_{\mathrm{max}}|^2}{\SWR} = \frac{Z_0}{2} \frac{|I_{\mathrm{max}}|^2}{\SWR}
\label{eq:power_loss_lossless_transmission_line_maxvoltage_maxcurrent}
\end{equation}
where $|V_{\mathrm{max}}| = \max_z |V(z)| = |\Vfwd| + |\Vrefl|$ and similarly for $|I_\mathrm{max}|$. Combining the above two expressions leads to convenient formulas for heat flux and breakdown estimations, which relates the maximum (peak) voltage or current to the forward power $P_\mathrm{f}$ and reflection coefficient $|\Gamma_L|$:
\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
		|V_\mathrm{max}| =& \sqrt{2 Z_0 P_\mathrm{f} } \left(1 + |\Gamma_L| \right) \\
		|I_\mathrm{max}| =& \sqrt{\frac{2 P_\mathrm{f}}{Z_0} } \left(1 + |\Gamma_L| \right)
	\end{align}
	\label{eq:max_current_function_forward_power_gammaL}
\end{subequations}

The power lost in the transmission line is converted into heat in the metallic conductors and dielectric elements due to Ohmic and dielectric losses respectively. For high power applications such as RF heating and current drive, this heat must be evacuated to sustain CW operation. Before expressing loss formulas for the main two kinds of transmission lines used for ICRH and LHCD, we recall here for future references that the power loss in a good conductor can be calculated as:
\begin{equation}
P_\ell = \frac{R_s}{2} \int_S |J_s|^2 \diff S = \frac{R_s}{2} \int_S |H_t|^2 \diff S 
\label{eq:power_loss_conductor}
\end{equation}
where the integral is performed over the conductor surface(s), $J_s$ and $H_t$ the surface current and the tengential magnetic field respectively\cite[§1.7]{pozar2012}. 

definition of the \textit{skin depth} $\delta_s$ (in $[\si{m}]$) as:
\begin{equation}
\delta_s 
	=
	\sqrt{\frac{2}{\omega \mu \sigma}}
	\label{eq:skin_depth}
\end{equation}
and the \textit{sheet resistance} $R_s$ (in $[\si{\Omega}]$) as:
\begin{equation}
R_s 
	= 
	\frac{1}{\delta_s \sigma}
	=
	\sqrt{\frac{\omega\mu}{2\sigma}}
	=
	\sqrt{\pi f \rho \mu }
	\label{eq:sheet_resistance}
\end{equation}
with $\sigma=1/\rho$ the metal conductivity (in $[\si{S/m}]$) and $\sigma$ the metal resistivity (in $[\si{\Omega m}]$).

\subsection{Matching Systems}\label{sec:matching_systems}
In high power RF systems for fusion applications, the load is ultimately the plasma facing the antennas. As seen in Section~\ref{sec:icrh} and Section~\ref{sec:lhcd}, the plasma loading impedance is generally small compared to antenna and transmission line. Hence, a significant amount of RF power will be reflected toward the generators. It is essential to protect high power RF sources (tetrodes, klystrons) from reflected power (output mismatch). Reflected power perturbs the source impedance, the output amplitude and phase and creates higher dissipation losses\sidecite[-1cm]{pompon2012}. It can also lead to the failure of RF windows \sidecite[-+0.5cm]{ikeda1989} or even damage the tube itself\sidecite{gold1997,carter2005,benford2007}. 

Unfortunately, the plasma characteristics depend on the machine setup but also on its history, hence its RF load properties are relatively little known in advance. In addition, plasma intrinsic instabilities, such as Edge Localized Modes (ELMs), can also induce strong and fast load variations in front of the antenna, which may affect strongly the generator performances for the aforementioned reasons\sidecite{braun1995, beaumont1996} or generate breakdown in antennas and transmission lines due to peak voltage increases \sidecite{bobkov2003-1, goniche2012-2}. 

\begin{marginfigure}[*+5]
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/chap3/transmission_line_matching}
	\caption{Matching a load impedance $Z_L$ to a source having an internal impedance $Z_S$.}
	\label{fig:transmission_matching}
\end{marginfigure}

Let us consider the simplified network illustrated in Fig.\ref{fig:transmission_matching}. Classical results of RF engineering state that\cite{Rizzi1988, pozar2012}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Conjugate Matching: maximum available power goes into the load if $Z_L=Z_S^*$
	\item Impedance Matching: minimum reflection ($\Gamma_L=0, \SWR=1$) is obtained for $Z_L=Z_S$
\end{itemize} 
As in typical plasma application the load impedance $Z_L$ is complex-valued, achieving both objectives at the same time is not possible. For this reason, a set of matching networks must be inserted between the source and the load as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:transmission_matching_system}. Ideally, such a matching system should meet the following objectives (sometimes interrelated):
\begin{itemize}
	\item maximize the power transfer to the antenna 
	\item minimize the power reflected to the generator (protection and efficiency)
	\item minimize the power lost in the transmission line (net efficiency)
	\item insure the good control of the antenna amplitude/phase
\end{itemize}

If the generator is not equipped with internal matching network, it is a good engineering practice to place a matching network as close as possible from its output. Similarly, placing a matching network as close as possible from the load reduce the standing waves and thus the peak current (dissipation problems) and the peak voltage (corona and breakdown problems) in the transmission line between the source and the load \cite[§4]{Rizzi1988}.

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/chap3/transmission_line_matching_system}
	\caption{A matching system is inserted between the source and the load impedance.}
	\label{fig:transmission_matching_system}
\end{figure}

Matching is frequency dependant since it deals with the adjustment of reactances. The perfect impedance match can occur only at one frequency but high power sources are usually very narrowband. If the source frequency can be tuned, which is the case of ICRH generators, matching networks are designed to be tunable. Such system use stub (shunt coaxial section that ends in a movable short) and line stretchers (transmission line section that can vary its electrical distance). In theory, a one-quarter-wavelength stub in conjunction with a half-wavelength stretcher can match any impedance to the generator\sidecite{england1989}. However, the actuators of these systems rely on motors (capacitors) or hydraulic systems (tuning stub, line stretchers), so their response time is of the order to 100 milliseconds or higher, which is much slower than most uncontrolled plasma variations. For this reason, fusion RF antenna are designed to be intrinsically relatively load-tolerant, using specific feeding line or antenna design.

\subsection{Scattering Parameters}
Voltage  $V(z)$ and current $I(z)$ as defined in Eq.(\ref{eq:voltage_current_lossy_line}) in the previous section are the "real" waves in the sense that they are linked directly to Maxwell’s equations and can be measured. For example, reflection coefficients $\Gamma(z)$ can be measured from the peaks and valleys of the electric fields of the standing wave created by the beating of forward and reflected voltages and currents in a slotted-line experiment \sidecite{marks1992, williams2013}. 

A RF \textit{network} such as the one illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:microwave_network}, is a system for which a closed surface separating the network from the rest of the world can be found such that it has zero current on this surface ($\hat{\mathbf{n}} \times \Ebf=0$) except over one or more input/output \textit{port} cross-section \cite[§8.3]{Harrington2001}. The electrical behaviour of linear electrical networks is often handled using impedances or admittances parameters, relating voltages to currents at each port (or reference planes). Direct measurements of these impedances or admittances of a RF network requires that the ports be terminated in either short or open circuits. However, as lead inductance and capacitance make short and open circuits difficult to obtain at RF frequencies, such terminations are often hard to realize correctly. Since power transfer is often a crucial characteristic of RF network designs, \textit{scattering parameters} (or S-parameters) are often preferred by microwave engineers since they relate the power flow of forward and reflected voltage waves at each port. Finally, scattering parameters are also well suited for describing transistors and other active devices, since short and open  terminations could result in undesired behavior, including oscillation or destruction\sidecite{steer2019-1}.

\begin{marginfigure}[*-15]
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/chap3/microwave_network}
	\caption{A 3 ports RF Network.}
	\label{fig:microwave_network}
\end{marginfigure}

Scattering parameters can be defined in several ways \sidecite{dobrowolski2010}, which has been discussed extensively in the literature since the 60's \cite{carlin1956, kurokawa1965, woods1972, marks1992, williams2013, amakawa2016}. Indeed, there is some arbitrariness to define some forward and reflected waves ($a, b$) such that ($|a|^2, |b|^2$) represent the time-averaged power carried by the forward and reflected voltage waves ($\Vfwd, \Vrefl$) (or current waves, or both). However, as seen in section \ref{sec:power_and_losses}, the power superposition principle does not hold for lossy lines and complex characteristic impedances (but superposition of voltages and currents does), so this mapping cannot be done in general. The various definitions of scattering parameters differ on how they handle complex impedances and eventually additional modes other than TEM, but all of these definitions give the same results for real-valued characteristic impedances and lossless lines\footnote{Because most of time lossless lines are assumed, this is probably the reason why most textbooks assume that the characteristic impedance is real in their presentation of scattering parameters. While complex-referenced S-parameters may be seen as a matter of purely academic concern with little practical use, it is not and it has also implications in electromagnetic simulators that are often silent on how they implement such situations.}. To deal with lossy lines and complex characteristic impedances, few methodologies exist but two are nowadays mostly adopted: \textit{power-wave} and \textit{pseudo-wave}  definitions. 

The \textit{power-waves} concept has been introduced in \sidecite{kurokawa1965}, where the forward $a$ and reflected $b$ power-waves are defined as:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
	a =& \frac{V_i + Z_{R,i} I_i}{2\sqrt{|\Re(Z_{R,i})|}} \\
	b =& \frac{V_i - Z_{R,i}^* I_i}{2\sqrt{|\Re(Z_{R,i})|}}
\end{align}
\label{eq:power-waves_definition}
\end{subequations}
where $V_i$ and $I_i$ are the total voltage and current flowing into the $i$th port of the network. $Z_{i}$ is the $i$th port reference impedance. The choice of the reference impedance is free; a common practice is to set its value to the impedance of a load or a generator, enabling power waves to be used in matching problems. With power-waves, the power flowing at the port interface is:
\begin{equation}
	p_{\mathrm{pw}} = \frac{1}{2} \left( |a|^2 - |b|^2 \right)
\end{equation}

As seen in the previous section, impedance match and maximum power transfer are in general not coincident. For the latter condition, a conjugate match is required, i.e. when $Z_0 = Z_L^*$ using the notation of Fig.~\ref{fig:transmissionlinepropertiesvi}. Power-waves are defined in such a way that a conjugate match produces no reflection, and also in such a way that the incident wave carries the available power of the source and the reflected wave the total reflected power from the load\sidecite{woods1972}. Thus, the power-wave reflection coefficient is defined by:
\marginnote{To be compared with Eq.(\ref{eq:Gamma_L}).}
\begin{equation}
	\Gamma_{\mathrm{pw}} = \frac{Z_0 - Z_L^*}{Z_0 + Z_L}
\end{equation}

This definition introduces "wave" variables that can no longer be interpreted as incoming and outgoing waves from ports. However, they can be interpreted in terms of power flow at a junction, which explains its wide adoption by the RF community. Most RF circuit solvers (such as Keysight ADS, ANSYS Circuit) use the \textit{power-waves} definition introduced. \marginnote[*-4]{Because of its wide adoption, \href{http://scikit-rf.org/}{scikit-rf} also uses the power-waves definition by default (mostly in order to replicate results from commercial solvers) but allows the use of pseudo-wave definition as well.} 

However, the power-wave definition has some caveats one must be aware of. In particular, power-waves definition may not give physical results in case of complex characteristic impedance\footnote{A simple illustration of the problem is to consider a transmission line of complex characteristic impedance $Z_0$ loaded with a an impedance $Z_L=Z_0^*$. Voltage and current waves as defined at the beginning of this section will lead to a non zero reflection coefficient $\Gamma_L$ while power-waves-based tools will give a zero reflection coefficient $\Gamma_\mathrm{pw,L}$\cite{amakawa2016}.} and are not always continuous at the interface between circuits unless reference impedance is real, so cannot be cascaded in all cases{marks1992, williams2013}. In the real world, all transmission lines are lossy (at least to a small degree) and this contradiction has been identified shortly after Kurokawa seminal paper\cite{amakawa2016} but somewhat forgotten after. For this reason, \citeauthyear{marks1992} introduced the \textit{pseudo-waves} definition of S-parameters\footnote{where a phase factor used in \cite{marks1992} has been omitted here for simplification.}:\marginnote{Again, the pseudo-wave definition equals the travelling-wave definition when $\Zref$ is real-valued. This paragraph aims only to highlight the fact that great care should be taken when dealing with S-parameters with lossy transmission lines with electromagnetic solvers, in particular closed-source ones.}
\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
		a_i =& \frac{\sqrt{\Re(Z_{R,i})}}{|Z_{R,i}|} \Vfwd_i 
		= \frac{\sqrt{\Re(Z_{R,i})}}{|Z_{R,i}|} \frac{V_i + Z_{R,i} I_i}{2} \\
		b_i =& \frac{\sqrt{\Re(Z_{R,i})}}{|Z_{R,i}|} \Vrefl_i 
= \frac{\sqrt{\Re(Z_{R,i})}}{|Z_{R,i}|} \frac{V_i - Z_{R,i} I_i}{2}		
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $Z_{R,i}$ is an arbitrary value which can be different from the characteristic impedance $Z_0$ of the physical transmission line at the $i$th port. $a$ and $b$ are not longer directly related to voltage and curent travelling wave and only when $Z_{R}$ equals to $Z_0$ do $a$ and $b$ correspond to actual travelling wave amplitude (normalized to unit of $\sqrt{\si{W}}$). The power $p$ transmitted by a pseudo-wave at the port interface is:
\begin{equation}
p = \frac{1}{2} \left(|a|^2 - |b|^2 - 2\Im(a^* b) \frac{\Im(\Zref)}{\Re(\Zref)} \right)
\end{equation}

For a N-port network, with both definitions, the forward and reflected waves are related by:
\begin{equation}
	\bbf = \Sbb \abf
\end{equation}
where the $\abf$ and $\bbf$ array are constituted of the $a_i$ and $b_i$ elements. Properties of S-matrices are discussed in \sidecite{gonzalez1997, dobrowolski2010} to name of few and are not covered here.

\subsection{Coaxial Lines}\label{sec:coaxial_lines}
% #####################################################
\subsubsection{Coaxial Lines Main Properties}
A coaxial line is made of two cylindrical conductors, the internal of radius $a$ and the external of radius $b$, encapsulated one inside the other as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:coaxial_line_geometry}. The space between both conductors is filled with a dielectric. In high power application, conductors are made of rigid metallic cylinder (aluminium or stainless steel) eventually copper or silver coated to reduce RF losses. The dielectric is simply (dry) air, pressurized nitrogen or vacuum to reduce dielectric breakdown. 

% #####################################################
\subsubsection{Electric and Magnetic Fields}
The fundamental mode in a coxial line is a TEM mode as both electric and magnetic field are transverse to the propagation direction. This mode has no cut-off and therefore coaxial can be used down to DC.

\begin{marginfigure}[*-10]
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/chap3/coaxial}
	\caption{Coaxial Line Geometry}
	\label{fig:coaxial_line_geometry}
\end{marginfigure}

The electric and magnetic field inside the coaxial are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:coaxial_line_fields} and given by:
\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
		\Ebf(r) =& \frac{V}{r \ln \left(b/a \right)} \hat\ebf_r \label{eq:coaxial_electric_field}\\
		\Hbf(r) =& \frac{I}{2\pi r} \hat\ebf_\phi \label{eq:coaxial_magnetic_field}
	\end{align}
	
\end{subequations}
where $V=V_0 e^{\mp\gamma z}$ is the voltage between the conductors and $I=I_0 e^{\mp\gamma z}$ is the current in each conductor, for $a\leqslant r \leqslant b$. 

\begin{marginfigure}[*-8]

	\caption{TEM mode for a coaxial line}
	\label{fig:coaxial_line_fields}
\end{marginfigure}	

% #####################################################
\subsubsection{Characteristic Impedance}. 
The characteristic impedance $Z_0$ in $[\si{\Omega}]$ of a coaxial line is:
\begin{equation}
Z_0 = 
	\frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{\mu_0 \mu_r}{\varepsilon_{0} \varepsilon_{r}}} \ln\left( \frac{b}{a} \right)
	=
	60 \sqrt{\frac{\mu_r}{\varepsilon_{r}}} \ln\left( \frac{b}{a} \right) 
\end{equation}
\marginnote[-1cm]{Or also, $Z_0\approx 138 \sqrt{\frac{\mu_r}{\varepsilon_{r}}} \log_{10}\left( \frac{b}{a} \right)$}
with $\varepsilon_{r}$ the relative permittivity and $\mu_r$ the relative permeability of the filling dielectric. 

% #####################################################
\subsubsection{Power and Losses}
From Eq.(\ref{eq:coaxial_electric_field}), the maximum electric field is located on the inner conductor ($r=a$). The maximum voltage before breakdown $V_{\mathrm{max,bd}}$ is:
\begin{equation}
	V_{\mathrm{max,bd}} = a\ln\left(b/a\right) E_d
\end{equation}
where $E_d$ is the \textit{dielectric field strength} of the medium. For dry-air, this value is given as $3$~\si{MV/m} for dry air\cite[b§3.11]{pozar2012}.\marginnote{The field strength is vacuum is in theory much higher, however as detailed in Section~\ref{sec:Multipactor}, electrical breakdown in vacuum can occur because of other mechanisms.}. In a lossless coaxial line, the associated maximum power before breakdown $P_\mathrm{max,bd}$ is from Eq.(\ref{eq:power_loss_lossless_transmission_line})
\begin{equation}
	P_\mathrm{max,bd} =  \frac{V^2_{\mathrm{max,bd}} }{2 Z_0 \SWR}= \sqrt{\frac{\varepsilon_{r}}{\mu_r}} \frac{a^2 E_d^2}{120\,\SWR} \ln (b/a)
\end{equation}
This expression shows that the power capability can be increased by using a larger coaxial line for the same characteristic impedance or by increasing the $b/a$ ratio (higher characteristic impedance) and by reducing the $\SWR$.

The Ohmic heat flux $\Psi$ (in [$\si{W/m^2}$]) due to the flow of RF current on a conductor of diameter $\phi$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
\Psi(\phi,z) 
=
\frac{R_s}{2}
\frac{|I(z)|^2}{(\pi \phi)^2}
\label{eq:ohmic_heat_flux_coaxial}
\end{equation}
The previous expression can be used to calculate thermal behaviour of high power coaxial components (Fig.~\ref{fig:coaxial_losses}). The Ohmic power loss per unit length $P_\ell$ (in \si{W/m}) dissipated in a coaxial line is the sum of the inner and the outer conductors losses:
\begin{equation}
P_\ell (z)
=
\frac{1}{4 \pi}
\left(
\frac{R_{s,a}}{a} + \frac{R_{s,b}}{b}
\right)
|I(z)|^2
\end{equation}


\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{figures/chap3/coaxial_losses}

Inner conductor is in copper while the outer conductor is in aluminium. Heat flux from Eq.(\ref{eq:ohmic_heat_flux_coaxial}) is benchmarked against full-wave ANSYS HFSS.}
	\label{fig:coaxial_losses}
\end{figure}

%Finally, the attenuation $\alpha=P_\ell(z=0)/(2P_0)$ in $[\si{Neper/m}]$ of a coaxial line is\cite[Ex.2.7]{pozar2012}:
%\begin{equation}
%\alpha 
%	=
%	\frac{1}{4\pi Z_0}
%	\left(
%		\frac{R_{s,a}}{a} + \frac{R_{s,b}}{b}
%	\right)
%	+
%	\frac{1}{2}\omega \varepsilon'' \eta
%\end{equation}
%where $R_{s,a}$ and $R_{s,b}$ are the sheet resistances given by eq.\ref{eq:sheet_resistance} for inner and outer conductors respectively and $\eta=\sqrt{\mu/\varepsilon'}$ is the intrinsic impedance of the dielectric material filling the coaxial line.

\subsection{Rectangular Waveguides}\label{sec:rectangular_waveguide}
\subsubsection{Rectangular Waveguides Main Properties}
Electromagnetic wave can also propagate in hollow metallic structures filled with dielectric. The structure dimensions must be designed to the wavelength to transport. Waveguides can support different kinds of modes, the most conventiannol being TE (Transvere Electric) and TM (Transverse Magnetic) modes. 

\begin{marginfigure}[0cm]
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/chap3/rectangular_waveguide}
	\caption{Rectangular Waveguide Geometry}
	\label{fig:rectangular_waveguide_geometry}
\end{marginfigure}

A hollow rectangular waveguide of width $a$ and height $b$ is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:rectangular_waveguide_geometry}. Solving Maxwell’s equations for this geometry leads to multiple possible solutions, or \emph{modes}. In a rectangular waveguide, modes can be expressed as \emph{Transverse Electric} (TE) or \emph{Transverse Magnetic} (TM), depending of their respective polarization. Since the walls of a rectangular waveguide constrain the electromagnetic field boundary conditions along two dimensions, two integer indices $m$ and $n$ are used to describe a mode from another. Thus, modes in a rectangular waveguides can be $\TE_{mn}$ or $\TM_{mn}$\sidenote{With $m$ and $n$ integers greater or equal to 0 for $\TE$ modes and greater or equal to 1 for $\TM$ modes.}. These modes are eigenfunctions of the equation system and each mode is characterized by a wavenumber $\beta_{mn}$:
\begin{equation}
	\beta_{mn} = \sqrt{k^2_0 - k_{c,mn}^2 }
	\label{eq:rectwg_wavenumber}
\end{equation}
with $k_0=\omega\sqrt{\mu\varepsilon}=\sqrt{\mu_r \varepsilon_{r}}\omega/c$ and where $k_{c,mn}$ is the \textit{cut-off wavenumber}:
\marginnote{We recall here for convenience that the medium wavelength $\lambda$ is:
	$$
	\lambda = \frac{\lambda_0}{n} = \frac{v_\phi}{f}
	$$
	where $\lambda_0$ is the wavelength in vacuum, $v\phi$ is the phase velocity, $n=c/v_\phi=\sqrt{\mu_r \varepsilon_{r}}$ is the refractive index and $c=1/\sqrt{\mu_0 \varepsilon_{0}}$ the speed of light. We also define 
	$$
	\xi_0=\sqrt{\frac{\mu_0}{\varepsilon_{0}}}=120\pi=377\,\si{\Omega}
	$$ 
	as the vacuum characteristic impedance.
}
\begin{equation}
	k_{c,mn}
	=
	\sqrt{\left(\frac{m\pi}{a}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{n\pi}{b}\right)^{2}}
	\label{eq:rectwg_cutoff_wavenumber}
\end{equation}

Each mode has an associated \textit{cut-off frequency} $f_{c,mn}$, below which a mode cannot propagate in the guide:
\begin{equation}
	f_{c,mn} = \frac{k_{c,mn}}{2\pi\sqrt{\mu \varepsilon}}
	\label{eq:rectwg_cutoff-frequency}
\end{equation}
The mode $mn$ can propagate in a rectangular waveguide only if the operating frequency is higher than the cut-off frequency of the mode, i.e. $f>f_{c,mn}$. The mode with the lowest cut-off frequency is called the \textit{fundamental} or \textit{dominant} mode. Because we have assumed that $a>b$, the lowest cut-off frequency occurs for the $\TE_{10}$ ($m=1,n=0$) mode\sidenote{There are no $\TE_{00}$ mode.}. 

For practical applications, the dimensions of the waveguides are generally chosen in order to have one and only one mode allowed propagating for a specified frequency band. Other modes can eventually be excited by waveguides discontinuities, but can’t propagate since they are evanescent ($k^2_0 < k_{c,mn}^2$ in Eq.(\ref{eq:rectwg_wavenumber})). Such modes are referred to \textit{high order modes}. For high power applications, a great care is given to waveguide inner walls, bends and connections, since reflected power and breakdowns may occur due to discontinuities in the conducting walls, such as the ones caused by flange misalignments \sidecite{harvey1955,brady1965,kerr2010}, bumps, holes, etc.

\subsubsection{Electric and Magnetic Fields}
At a given frequency in a homogeneous-filled metallic hollow waveguide, the set of all possible TE and TM modes forms an orthogonal basis and a complete system\cite[§1.2]{marcuvitz1951},\cite[§5.2]{Collin1990},\cite[§8.2]{Harrington2001}. In practice, this sum is over all propagating modes and truncated to few evanescent modes only if needed, which is the case for antenna-plasma coupling calculations (Cf. Section~\ref{sec:lhcd}). In order to match the geometry usually used for plasma-wave coupling theory, we assume here that the large side of the waveguide is aligned in the direction $y$ and the short side in the direction of $z$. The waveguide cross-section is supposed homogenous in the $x$ direction. The geometry of a rectangular waveguide is illustrated in Fig.\ref{fig:rectangular_waveguide_geometry_fields}. The transverse electromagnetic fields can be expressed the summation of these modes:

\begin{marginfigure}[0cm]
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/chap3/rectangular_waveguide_fields}
	\caption{Rectangular Waveguide Geometry and $\TE_{10}$ mode pattern derived from Eq.(\ref{eq:rectwg_EHfields_TE10})}
	\label{fig:rectangular_waveguide_geometry_fields}
\end{marginfigure}

\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
\mathbf{E}_{t}(\mathbf{r}) = & \sum_{p,m,n} V_{pmn}(x)\mathbf{e}_{pmn} (y,z)
\label{eq:E_guides_somme_modes}\\
\mathbf{H}_{t}(\mathbf{r}) = & \sum_{p,m,n} I_{pmn}(x)\mathbf{h}_{pmn} (y,z)
\label{eq:H_guides_somme_modes}
	\end{align}
\label{eq:rectwg_transverse_fields_sum_modes}
\end{subequations}
with $V_{pmn}$ and $I_{pmn}$ the eigenvalues of a mode $p=\{\TE,\TM\}$ of indexes $(m,n)$ and $\gamma_{pmn}=j\beta_{pmn}$ its associated wavenumber. 

\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
V_{pmn}(x) = & A_{pmn}e^{-\gamma_{pmn}x} + B_{pmn}e^{+\gamma_{pmn}x}
\label{eq:valeur_propre_V}\\
I_{pmn}(x) = & \frac{1}{Z_{pmn}}\left(A_{pmn}e^{-\gamma_{pmn}x} - B_{pmn}e^{+\gamma_{pmn}x}\right)
\label{eq:valeur_propre_I}
	\end{align}
	 \label{eq:rectwg_modes_eigenvalues}
\end{subequations}
with $Z_{pmn}$ the mode characteristic impedance:
\begin{equation}
Z_{pmn} = 
\begin{cases}
\frac{j\omega\mu}{\gamma_{mn}} = \frac{j k_0 \xi_0}{\gamma_{mn}} & \mathrm{\, for\, \TE\, modes}\\
\frac{\gamma_{mn}}{j\omega\varepsilon}=\frac{\gamma_{mn} \xi_0}{j k_0} & \mathrm{\, for\,\TM\, modes}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

The model eingenfunction for rectangular waveguides are\cite[§2.2]{marcuvitz1951},\cite[§8.1,§8.2]{Harrington2001},\cite[§5.4]{Collin1990},\cite[§3.3]{pozar2012},\cite[Appendix A]{Bers1981} for TE modes:
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbf{e}_{mn}^{\TE}(y,z) & = & -\ebf_x \times \mathbf{h}_{mn}^{\TE} = \ebf_x \times \nabla_{t} \psi_{mn}\\
\mathbf{h}_{mn}^{\TE}(y,z) & = &  \ebf_x \times \mathbf{e}_{mn}^{\TE} = -\nabla_{t} \psi_{mn}
\label{eq:TEmodes_eingenfunctions}
\end{eqnarray}
and mode TM modes:
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbf{e}_{mn}^{\TM}(y,z) & = & -\nabla_{t}\phi_{mn}\\
\mathbf{h}_{mn}^{\TM}(y,z) & = & \ebf_x \times\mathbf{e}_{mn}^{\TM}= -\ebf_x \times\nabla_{t}\phi_{mn}
\label{eq:TMmodes_eingenfunctions}
\end{eqnarray}
The longitudinal components are given by:
\begin{eqnarray}
E_{x}^{TM} & = & \sum_{m,n}\frac{k_{c,mn}^{2}}{j k_{0}}\xi_0 I_{m,n}(x)\phi_{mn}(y,z)\\
H_{x}^{TE} & = & \sum_{m,n}\frac{k_{c,mn}^{2}}{j k_{0}}\xi_0^{-1} V_{m,n}(x)\psi_{mn}(y,z)
\label{eq:TETM_longitudinal_components}
\end{eqnarray}
$\psi$ and $\phi$ are the generator functions (\emph{transverses field pattern mode functions}). For a rectangular waveguide\cite[Table 8.1]{Harrington2001}\cite[§1.2 (6.c),§2.2]{marcuvitz1951}\cite[Appendix A, A13-14]{Bers1981}:
\begin{eqnarray}
\psi_{mn} & = & \frac{1}{\pi}\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_{m}\epsilon_{n}}{m^{2}\frac{b}{a}+n^{2}\frac{a}{b}}}\cos\left(\frac{m\pi}{a}y\right)\cos\left(\frac{n\pi}{b}z\right)\label{eq:fonction_generatrice_TE}\\
\phi_{mn} & = & \frac{2}{\pi}\sqrt{\frac{1}{m^{2}\frac{b}{a}+n^{2}\frac{a}{b}}}\sin\left(\frac{m\pi}{a}y\right)\sin\left(\frac{n\pi}{b}z\right)\label{eq:fonction_generatrice_TM}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\epsilon_{k}=1$ if $k=0$ or $\epsilon_{k}=2$ otherwise.

Since these solutions form a orthogonal basis, the following integral over the waveguide cross-section $S$ gets\cite{marcuvitz1951,Collin1990}:

\begin{equation}
\left\langle \mathbf{f},\mathbf{g}\right\rangle 
=
\iint_{S}\mathbf{f}(y,z)\mathbf{\cdot g}(y,z)\, \diff y\, \diff z
\label{eq:rectwg_scalar_product}
\end{equation}
in particular:
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:relations_orthogonalite}
	\begin{eqnarray}
	\left\langle \mathbf{e}_{mn}^{\TE},\mathbf{e}_{m'n'}^{\TE}\right\rangle  & = & \delta_{m=m',n=n'}\\
	\left\langle \mathbf{e}_{mn}^{\TE},\mathbf{h}_{m'n'}^{\TE}\right\rangle  & = & \delta_{m=m',n=n'}\\
	\left\langle \mathbf{e}_{mn}^{\TE},\mathbf{e}_{m'n'}^{\TM}\right\rangle  & = & 0\\
	\left\langle \mathbf{e}_{mn}^{\TE},\mathbf{h}_{m'n'}^{\TM}\right\rangle  & = & 0
	\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
where $\delta_{m=m',n=n'}=1$ if $m=m'$ and $n=n'$, $0$ otherwise.

For the fundamental mode $\TE_{10}$ (with $a>b$), one has in particular:
\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
\psi_{10}(y) &= 
	\frac{1}{\pi} \sqrt{\frac{2a}{b}} \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{a} y\right) 
	\\
\Ebf_t(x,y) =& 
	-  \sqrt{\frac{2}{ab}} \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{a} y\right)V_{10}(x) \hat\ebf_z 
	\\
\Hbf_t(x,y) =& 
	   \sqrt{\frac{2}{ab}} \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{a} y\right)I_{10}(x)\hat\ebf_y 
	\\
H_x(x,y) =& 
	\frac{k_{c,10}^2}{j \omega\mu} \frac{1}{\pi} \sqrt{\frac{2a}{b}} \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{a} y\right) V_{10}(x)
	\end{align}
	\label{eq:rectwg_EHfields_TE10}
\end{subequations}
\marginnote[-3cm]{We we have used $\omega\mu=k_0\xi_0=\beta_{mn}Z_{mn}$.}

% #####################################################
\subsubsection{Power and Losses}
The previous choice of normalization factors leads to simple time-average power flow along a rectangular waveguide:
\begin{equation}
P=\iint\frac{1}{2}\Re\left[\mathbf{E}_{t}\times\mathbf{H}_{t}^{*}\right]\cdot \hat \ebf_x \diff S
=
\sum_{l}\frac{1}{2Z_{l}}\left(\left|A_{l}\right|^{2}-\left|B_{l}\right|^{2}\right)
\label{eq:poynting}
\end{equation}
where the sum is over the propagating modes only. 

Since the $\TE_{10}$ mode is the fundamental mode and the most used to transfer the RF power, we will specify some quantities for $m=1,n=0$. Using Eqs.(\ref{eq:rectwg_EHfields_TE10}), the power flow down the guide for the $\TE_{10}$ is:
\begin{equation}
	P_{10} = \frac{1}{2} \Re \iint_S  \left(\Ebf \times \Hbf^* \right)\cdot \hat\ebf_x \diff y \diff z
	= \frac{1}{2} \Re\left[V_{10}(x) I^*_{10}(x) \right]
	\label{eq:rectwg_poynting_TE10_V10_I10}
\end{equation}
which reads from Eqs.(\ref{eq:rectwg_modes_eigenvalues}):
\begin{equation}
	P_{10} = \frac{1}{2Z_{10}}\left(\left|A_{10}\right|^{2}-\left|B_{10}\right|^{2}\right)
	\label{eq:rectwg_poynting_TE10_A10_B10} = P_\mathrm{i} -  P_\mathrm{r}
\end{equation}
where $P_\mathrm{i}$ (in [\si{W}]) is the forward power and $P_\mathrm{r}$ the reflected power. Coefficients $|A_{10}|$ and $|B_{10}|$ can then be related conveniently to the forward and reflected power:
\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
	|A_{10}| =& \sqrt{2Z_{10} P_\mathrm{i}} \\
	|B_{10}| =& \sqrt{2Z_{10} P_\mathrm{r}} =  R |A_{10}|
	\end{align}	
\end{subequations}	
where we have used the "voltage" reflection coefficient $R$ defined by $R^2=P_\mathrm{r}/P_\mathrm{i}$. Using all the previous definitions, the electromagnetic field in Eqs.(\ref{eq:rectwg_EHfields_TE10}) can be directly related to forward and reflected powers, giving peak values comparable to full-wave calculations and for breakdown analysis. A simple benchmark of these relations is given on Fig.\ref{fig:rectwg_benchmark_fields}.

The electric field for the $\TE_{10}$ mode is maximum at $x=a/2$ (in the middle of the waveguide). This peak electric field value for this mode is:
\begin{equation}
	\left| E_{y,\mathrm{max}} \right|
	=
	2 \sqrt{\frac{Z_{10} P_\mathrm{i}}{a b }} 
		\left( 
			1 + R
		\right)
\end{equation}

The maximum incident power before breakdown for a given reflection coefficient in a dielectric-filled rectangular waveguide is thus:
\begin{equation}
	P_{\mathrm{max,bd}}
	= 
	\frac{a b}{4 Z_{10}} \frac{E_d^2}{\left(1 + R\right)^2}
\end{equation}
with $E_d$ the electric strength of the medium. The previous expression shows that the maximum power is again obtained for a minimum reflection coefficient and increase with the waveguide dimensions. 

The Ohmic loss is not homogeneous in a rectangular waveguide. The Ohmic power loss density (in [$\si{W/m^2}$]) is, for the large ($\Psi_a$) and the small ($\Psi_b$) sides of the waveguide respectively:
\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
		\Psi_a(x,y)
		=& \frac{R_s}{2} \left(\left| H_x(x,y) \right|^2 + \left| H_y(x,y) \right|^2 \right)
\\
		\Psi_b(x)
		=& \frac{R_s}{2} \left| H_x(x,0) \right|^2 
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}

From symmetry, the currents on the top and bottom walls are identical, as are the currents on the small walls. So, the Ohmic power loss per unit length $P_\ell$ (in \si{W/m}) for a waveguide is then: 
\begin{equation}
P_\ell (z)
= 
2\int_0^a  \Psi_a(x,z) \diff x 
+ 
2\int_0^b  \Psi_b(z) \diff y 
\end{equation}
which reads:
\begin{equation}
P_\ell (z)
= 
R_s \left[
	\frac{1}{b} \left| I_{10} \right|^2 
	+ 
	\left(
		2a + \frac{a^2}{b}
	\right)
	\frac{k_{c,10}^2}{(\omega\mu\pi)^2} 
	\left| V_{10} \right|^2 
\right]
\label{eq:rectwg_power_loss_per_unit_length}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Coupling Elements}
In order to excite the Fast-Waves in the Ion Cyclotron range of frequencies ($f=$30-80~MHz) as required for plasma heating, the wave electric field needs to be perpendicular to both $\Bbf_0$ and $\mathbf{k}$. In this rang of frequencies, the wavelength of the electromagnetic waves is of order of few meters, so larger or of the same order as the machine size. To excite the Fast-Wave, ICRH antennas usually consist in array of loop radiators similar to strip-lines, or \textit{straps}, to excite waves directly inside the vacuum vessel (Figure~\ref{fig:icrhantennasimplified}). These straps are oriented perpendicularly to the direction of the magnetic field $B_0$\footnote{In tokamaks, the total magnetic field being slightly tilted with respect to the toroidal direction, straps should have a complex shape to produce fields with the proper polarization. While possible and more accessible nowadays than before with modern manufacturing techniques, building such straps is complex and most antennas use strap oriented in the poloidal direction, i.e. perpendicular to the toroidal magnetic field.}. The antenna geometry and the amplitude and phase distribution of the flowing RF currents $J_{RF}$ on these straps shapes the wavenumber spectrum $E_{RF}(k)$ excited by the antenna. The antenna having a characteristic toroidal size (of tens of centimetres) much smaller than the wave wavelength, most plane waves excited by the antenna are evanescent. The distance to the plasma is thus a crucial parameter for the coupling performances, so antennas are generally made conform as possible to the plasma to minimize the distance from the strap to the plasma.

\end{marginfigure}

Unfortunately, it was identified early that coupling structures do not excite only Fast-Waves but also Slow-Waves \sidecite{evrard1982-1}. Slow-Waves are produced by RF currents parallel to the magnetic field as well by oscillating space charges on the antenna structure. For this reason, early ICRH experiments introduced the use of electrostatic shield, or \textit{Faraday Screen} \sidecite{england1989}. A Faraday Screen is formed by an array of metallic strips (or bars), aligned with the total magnetic field \sidecite{bures1990}. By screening the electric field components parallel to the strips/bars (Figure~\ref{fig:icrhfaradayscreenprinciple}), it aims acting as a polarizer, to filter out specifically the undesirable Slow-Wave. A denser screen better isolates the central conductor of the antenna from the plasma, but it also causes significant magnetic shielding and enhanced Ohmic losses in the screen \sidecite{faulconer1983}, leading to actively cooled structures. Various experiments have shown the benefits of faraday Screen \sidecite{noterdaeme1986, bures1990, myra1990}, but some also concluded that heating performance of unshielded antenna was found to be similar to that of a shielded antenna \sidecite{nieuwenhove1991, nieuwenhove1992}.  Although it might be necessary to keep a Faraday shield for other reasons, such as decoupling of thermal and mechanical stresses on plasma facing components, the question of the necessity of a Faraday Screen in future ICRH antennas is still an open question in the ICRH community \sidecite{noterdaeme2019}.

\subsubsection{Matching}\label{sec:ICRH_matching_systems}
From the RF engineer point of view, an ICRH system is equivalent to transmission line loaded with a complex impedance (Figure~\ref{fig:icrhantennacircuitmodel}). The antenna can be view as an impedance which properties depend on the plasma. 

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/chap3/ICRH_antenna_circuit_model}
	\caption{Simplified model of a ICRH system.}
	\label{fig:icrhantennacircuitmodel}
\end{figure}

A single strap element can be modelled by a line terminated with a lumped impedance $Z_L = R + j X$ \sidecite{bhatnagar1982}. Without plasma, the resistive part of this load represents the antenna Ohmic losses, which are generally small ($R \propto 10^{-1}~\si{\Omega}$. In front of a magnetized plasma, part of the waves are coupled to the plasma and the resistive part of the load increases. Hence, for the circuit point of view, coupling is indistinguishable from increasing losses. In most tokamak experiments, the resistive loading is in the 0.5 to 10 $\si{\Omega}$ range \sidecite{pinsker1998}. The reactive part is mostly inductive. Its value depends mainly of the strap and antenna geometry is generally much higher than the resistive part. In addition, changes of the resistive part are also correlated with changes in the reactive part \cite{pinsker1998}\sidenote{The electrical equivalent length of the antenna is then usually reduced when facing a plasma.}. Since the characteristic impedance of the transmission line $Z_0$ is usually between 30 to 50~$\si{\Omega}$, we always have $R \ll Z_0$ and hence a matching unit is necessary to maximize the power coupled to the plasma by the antenna.

Moreover, sudden changes in antenna loading arise in tokamaks operating in H-mode. During plasma perturbations (such like ELMs), loading rises on a time scale of ~100~ms and subsequently decays on a time scale of a few milliseconds. This sub-millisecond timescale represents a challenge to any dynamic impedance matching scheme implemented in ICRH systems\sidecite{hofmeister1994, ladurelle1997, evrard2005, noterdaeme2005, prechtl2009, grine2012, lin2015}, because their response time is not fast enough. To cope with these fast events, inherently load insensitive schemes, or \textit{load-resilient}, are desirable. At ASDEX-Upgrade, the load resilient system used to maintain the RF power during H-mode is exclusively the 3dB hybrid coupler system. The reflected power is mainly redirected toward a dummy load thanks to the symmetrical properties of the 3dB coupler. At JET, three different load resilient systems are employed. Firstly, a hybrid system feeds antennas A and B. Secondly, a conjugated-T system (resilient antenna) with internal matching is plugged to the ITER-Like Antenna (ILA). Part of the matching is made by vacuum capacitors connected close to the antenna. Thirdly, a conjugated T system with external matching feeds antennas C and D. Part of the matching is made by phase shifters connected far from the antennas.

\todo{below}
\subsubsection{RF Sheaths}
Early ICRH experiments have reported non-linear interactions between high power RF waves and edge plasma, leading to the production of influx of impurities which prevented efficient heating of the plasma \sidecite{rothman1966}. Since then, despite improvements in antenna design and plasma operation which substantially reduced these undesirable phenomenon \sidecite{noterdaeme1993}, it still remains an important operational limitation of ICRH \sidecite{noterdaeme2019-1}. One mechanism leading to the release impurities during ICRH operation is RF sheaths rectification. 

Because of their mass difference, there is a discrepancy between ions and electrons motions along magnetic field lines. Electrons accumulate faster than ions on Plasma Facing Components (PFC) and form a thin negatively biased layer that repulses electrons and attracts ions. This attraction increases the ion parallel energy into the wall and thus enhance the heavy ion bombardment of the PFC. Ion impacting the PFC can cause sputtering of impurities that can reach and contaminate the plasma. In the presence RF waves parallel to the magnetic field lines (which corresponds to the Slow-Wave polarization) driven by ICRH antenna, sheaths are enhanced. Instead of being constant in time, DC potential drop across the sheath is then the superposition of a DC component and a RF oscillations, called \textit{RF-induced sheath rectification}. This  mechanism has been identified as a major reason for the increased interaction with the wall as is still an intense research topic \sidecite{bobkov2019}.

\subsection{WEST ICRH Antennas Design}
\marginnote{Parts of this section are taken from \citeauthyear{hillairet2015-2} and CEA/IRFM internal reports made in 2013-2014 during the design of the WEST ICRH antennas.}

Three new identical ELM-resilient and CW power ICRH antennas have been designed for WEST. The ELM resilience property is obtained through an internal conjugate-T electrical scheme with series capacitors\sidecite{bosia2003-1}. The antenna design is based on a previously tested prototype in 2004 and 2007 at 48~MHz \sidecite{vulliez2008, argouarch2009}, illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:proto2007antenna}. 

\begin{figure}

	\caption{CAD model of the "2007 Prototype" antenna.}
	\label{fig:proto2007antenna}
\end{figure}

In the frame of the Associated Laboratory in the fusion field between IRFM and ASIPP, the 2007 design has been upgraded for WEST in order to: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item improve the power capabilities and coupling resistance from the previous prototype   \sidecite{helou2015-1}
	\item increase the nominal frequency range to 55~MHz to match WEST scenarios\sidecite{bourdelle2015}
	\item allow CW operation with actively cooled components \sidecite{chen2015, vulliez2015}.
\end{itemize} 
All these aspects led to iterate between RF and mechanical design, with generally opposite constraints and necessary compromises\sidenote{In order to improve the mechanical assembly of the WEST antenna in comparison to the 2007 prototype, the main dimensions changes have been proposed by K.Vulliez, A.Argouarch and P.Mollard for the conceptual design review in 2013 and assessed after from the RF point of view in an internal note\sidecite{hillairet2014-1}}. While the ICRH system upgrade for the WEST project also concerned the generator update and the moving of an antenna from port Q5 to port Q4A, this section only focuses on the antenna design.

\end{figure}


% ###################################################
\subsubsection{Front Parts}
With respect to the 2007 prototype, the front face of the WEST ICRH antennas have undergone few major changes in order to meet the following objectives:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Increase the antenna overall coupling resistance $R_c$ (Eq.(\ref{eq:coupling_resistance}))
	\item Increase the nominal antenna frequency to 55~MHz
	\item Water-cool the whole antenna, in particular the straps, the antenna box and the Faraday screen
	\item Minimize sheaths potential
\end{enumerate}

Increasing the coupling resistance allows coupling more power for a given set of voltages and currents. In other words, it also allows lowering capacitor voltages (and electric field) and currents for a given coupled power, which has operational and safety benefits\sidenote{In addition, the capacitor manufacturer COMET has lowered the maximum voltage and current specifications on its products between 2004 and 2013. Meeting lower voltage and current specifications.}. 

The frequency increase is a practical consequence of the changes of Tore Supra to become WEST\sidecite{bourdelle2015}: as the plasma volume was reduced and  shifted toward the high field side of the machine, locating the cyclotron resonance in the plasma centre requires higher RF frequencies (cf. Eq.(\ref{eq:cyclotron_resonance})). The desired frequency band of the ICRH system for WEST was thus asked to 48-60~MHz \todo{WEST ICRH guide}

\begin{marginfigure}

	\caption{Evolution of 2D CAD models for coupling optimization.}
	\label{fig:westfrontfaceevolution1}
\end{marginfigure}

From July 2013 to May 2014, the coupling of various models have been assessed using the COMSOL finite element software. Perfectly Match Layers (PMLs) boundary conditions adapted to plasma fast wave were used in 2D and 3D\sidecite{jacquot2013, colas2019}. Starting from the 2007 prototype geometry, the effects of geometrical modifications on coupling resistance have been assessed, from very simplified parametrized 2D (Figure~\ref{fig:westfrontfaceevolution1}) to almost final 3D geometries (Figure~\ref{fig:westfrontfaceevolution2}). These models used first experimental density profiles obtained in Tore Supra in 2007 (pulse \#40574) before using assumptions of WEST density profiles. In this pulse, an L-mode plasma has been moved horizontally over 5 cm in front of the load-resilient antenna prototype to assess its coupling properties at 48 MHz. The calculations have been performed for 8 profiles in order to make relative comparisons of the coupling resistance. 2D model run in few minutes while 3D models typically required ten to twenty hours depending on their complexity and the distance to the cut-off density on a desktop computer. These parametrized models allowed us to assess the relevant geometrical parameters (strap thickness, width, and distances to the plasma cut-off and antenna box) affecting the coupling resistance. In order to optimize the coupling resistance in dipole configuration, the thickness of the strap has been kept as low as possible (between 13 and 15 mm) while ensuring sufficient stiffness, since they are water cooled through 70$\si{\degreeCelsius}$/30~bars inner channels. As an example, at 57~MHz, increasing the strap thickness by 15 mm decreased the coupling resistance by 25\% for the same plasma loading. The coupling resistance of the new antennas has been increased compared to the prototypes one in particular by reducing the distance between the strap and the Faraday screen bars from 52~mm to 34~mm and by supressing a vertical septum which was masking a portion of the straps in the prototype (Figure~\ref{fig:westfrontfaceevolution1}). 

\begin{marginfigure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/chap3/WEST_ICRH/WEST_front_face_evolution2}
	\caption{Evolution of 3D CAD models for coupling optimization.}
	\label{fig:westfrontfaceevolution2}
\end{marginfigure}

Each antenna is equipped with four internal COMET tunable vacuum capacitors, with capacitances ranging from 15~pF to 150~pF and specifically upgraded for CW operation. In order to operate the antenna at a higher frequency, 55~MHz compared with the 48~MHz of the prototype, with the same capacitance range, the straps electrical length has been reduced in order to decrease their reactance $X_s$. However, increasing the coupling resistance also decreases the strap reactance $X_s$. Hence, trade-off were unavoidable between coupling efficiency and impedance matching as the desired frequencies. 

In addition, bringing closer the strap and its feeder leads to reduce the coupling resistance (-23\% decrease of the coupling resistance for 50~mm distance reduction). Increasing the toroidal width of the straps led to reduce the strap reactance but also to decrease the coupling resistance (-50\% decrease of the coupling resistance for +40~mm width increase). It has been kept to 130~mm, the same value as for the prototype. As the design of the antenna progressed, the coupling of few milestone CAD 3D models has been calculated with the TOPICA code \sidecite{milanesio2009} with the same plasma scenarios to assess the impact of mechanical design evolutions on the coupling performances.

	\label{fig:bridgeevolution}
\end{marginfigure}

In order to reduce the manufacturing cost as well to simplify the mechanical assembly design of the bridge, it has been proposed to design the bridge symmetrical with respect to its input transmission line. An idealized bridge/antenna box geometry which dimensions corresponding to the 2007 Prototype has been created and compared to one with an in-axis input transmission line (Figure~\ref{fig:bridgeevolution}). Minor changes were observed on both reflection and transmission. As a consequence, the WEST ICRH antenna bridges has been made symmetrical with respect to the input transmission line.

	\label{fig:bridgeevolution2}
\end{marginfigure}

Also in order to facilitate the mechanical assembly of the antenna, in particular the water pipes and diagnostic cables connection, it has been proposed to enlarge the distance between the rear part of the antenna box and the rear part of the bridge, ie. the dimensions $d_1$, $d_2$ and $d_3$ are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:bridgeevolution2}. The influence of each dimensions on RF performances have been assessed and it was proposed to keep the 2007 prototype ($d_1$=17.7~mm) value for the WEST antenna and not increasing it (keeping this value to the minimum possible from a mechanical point of view). The $d_2$ dimension could be increased by 20~mm from the 2007 prototype ($d_2$=30.8~mm) value for the WEST antenna ($d_2\to$50~mm). Increasing the length $d_3$ means increasing the strap electrical length. A +20~m ($d_3\to$30~mm.) increasing as been proposed, which impacts the matching capability of the antenna, especially for higher frequencies (50-60MHz). However, 

For the same reason, the radial length of the bridge labelled $L_3$ in Figure~\ref{fig:bridgeevolution3} has been increase by 50mm ($L_3\to $185.5~mm) for the WEST antenna. The $L_3$ length was found to has no impact on the VSWR of the antenna. Thus, the radial length of the bridge has been increased by50~mm ($L_3\to$185.5~mm) for the WEST antenna.

In this section, we illustrates some functionalities of the open source Python package \texttt{scikit-rf}  through the example of modelling the WEST Ion Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ICRH) antenna. The complete antenna circuit is made by connecting the various elements that compose it, separately full-wave modelled or using equivalent lumped models, like done with proprietary codes (i.e. owned by the person or the firm who has developed it)  in \sidecite{durodie2015, helou2015-2} or with commercial software such as ANSYS Designer in \sidecite[+1cm]{hillairet2015-2}.

}
	\label{fig:cometcapacitor}
\end{marginfigure}

The three WEST ICRH antennas are load tolerant resonant structures equipped with internal vacuum matching capacitors (Figure~\ref{fig:cometcapacitor}). These capacitors are tuned before the antenna operation or are real-time controlled to maintain low reflected power toward the RF sources \sidecite[+5cm]{hillairet2015, helou2015-2}. In order to forge a relevant numerical model of the antenna, it is thus needed to modify the capacitance of these matching capacitors. At least two approaches can be used: (i) using an equivalent lumped model of the capacitor or (ii) interpolating the capacitor S-parameters from full-wave simulations (if available). The challenge with the former is to use a relevant model to capture the RF behaviour of the capacitor in its operational environment, where parasitic capacitances/inductances may arise from surrounding elements and are mostly unknown. The main difficulty with the later is to design a full-wave parametrized model geometrically accurate, assuming dimensions and materials of the capacitor are known. Both approaches can be implemented with \texttt{scikit-rf} as the package is able to compute S-parameters of RF circuits made from ideal lumped elements (resistor/capacitor/inductor, in series/shunt configuration)  or to interpolate between N-port networks with same frequencies \footnote{Similar to the \texttt{NPort\_Multi} component in ANSYS Designer}. In the example below, both approaches are mixed: the capacitor (from COMET), which has been previously simulated with ANSYS HFSS for few different capacitance configurations during the PhD work of W.Helou \sidecite{helou2018}, is used to extract the lumped element parameters. Once fitted to an equivalent model, the capacitor networks can be driven as a function of their capacitances, while S-parameter interpolation only depend on of geometrical parameter (like the distance between capacitor electrodes).

A N-port electrical network is described in \texttt{scikit-rf} with the \texttt{Network} object, defined from its network parameters (S, Z, Y-parameters), port characteristic impedances and frequency information. It can be created from a file or directly from data. Importing all the touchstone files located in directory into a collection of \texttt{Network} in a \texttt{NetworkSet} object and plotting the real part of the $S_{21}$ parameter for each network for a subset of the frequency range is straightforward\footnote{Code snippets are complete minimal example but does not necessary reproduce all figure details such as line styles, markers or labels. Readers should refer to associated \href{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2668370}{online notebooks }for the full code listing.}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
import skrf as rf
# Read all the Touchstone file from a directory
capas_set = rf.NetworkSet.from_dir('S_Matrices/Capacitors')
# plot all S21 values for a given frequency band
# (Indexing starts at 0 in Python)
capas_set['20-80 MHz'].plot_s_re(m=1, n=0)
\end{lstlisting}

Assuming the \texttt{NetworkSet} contains $M$ networks coming from a parameter sweep of $M$ values described in a \texttt{param\_values} array, creating an interpolated network for a new value is achieved with:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
ntw = capas_set.interpolate_from_network(param_values, new_value)\end{lstlisting}

Figure~\ref{fig:capassets21db} illustrates the interpolation of $S_{21}$ at a given frequency for intermediate values of the swept parameter, here related to the distance between capacitor electrodes (noted $D_{cylinders}$). Obviously, the interpolation precision increases with the number of networks in the set.

	\label{fig:capacitor_equivalent_circuit_WEST}	  
\end{marginfigure}

However, in the case of the WEST ICRH antenna, the capacitor is inserted inside the antenna and is surrounded by the outer conductor elements, creating additional stray capacitances and inductances. In this situation, its turns out that the equivalent capacitance of the setup is modified \cite{helou2018}. The RF capacitance can nevertheless be extracted from full-wave calculation using a refined equivalent lumped model with additional shunt capacitances and R-L elements around the capacitor itself to model the proximity of the outer conductor housing and propagation effects\sidenote{The parallel resistor $R_p$ can be neglected in the tens of MHz frequency range considered here.} (Figure~\ref{fig:capacitor_equivalent_circuit_WEST}). Such electrical network can be constructed with \texttt{scikit-rf} with the following function:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
# here we neglect the parallel resistance R_p
freq = rf.Frequency(start=5, stop=95, npoints=101, unit='MHz')
# line is an ideal transmission line media
l = rf.media.DefinedGammaZ0(frequency=freq, z0=50)  
# ** is the scikit-rf network cascading operator
pre  = l.resistor(R1)**l.inductor(L1)**l.shunt_capacitor(C1)
post = l.shunt_capacitor(C1)**l.resistor(R1)**l.inductor(L1)
capa = l.resistor(R)**l.inductor(L)**l.capacitor(C)
capa_WEST = pre ** cap ** post  
\end{lstlisting}

Using the standard optimization toolbox shipped in the \href{https://www.scipy.org/}{\texttt{scipy}} package, the model parameters can be fitted for each full-wave network. Once done, full-wave references and lumped model can be compared. The Figure~\ref{fig:capacitor_interpolation} shows the calculated $S_{21}$ parameter which fit nice with the reference full-wave values. For most capacitance configurations, the error is below -40~dB. Taking constant lumped parameters ($R_s, L_s, C_1=C_2, R_1=R_2, L_1=L_2$) but $C$, the still matches well the full-wave reference except for the lowest range of capacitance values, in a region where the relationship between the electrodes distance and the capacitance is no more linear. The model can thus be used to determine a realistic relationship between the RF capacitance and the capacitor configuration (driven by motors).

\subsubsection{Antenna RF Circuit}
In \texttt{scikit-rf}, there is at least two ways of building a RF circuit made of various networks. The first method consists in connecting networks one by one using \texttt{Network} methods. A second method consists in defining all the connections between networks and ports at once time, then use the \texttt{Circuit} object to build the resultant network. While the later method can be more verbose than the former, it has some advantages when the circuit has many connections. \texttt{Circuit} uses a systematic solving method giving both internal (for each circuit connections) and external (for ports) S-parameters for an arbitrary number of networks and interconnections and independently of the circuit excitation \sidecite{hallbjorner2003}. By imposing excitations at ports, it allows obtaining voltages/currents inside the circuit.

The Figure~\ref{fig:antenna_circuit} schematizes a half WEST ICRH antenna, where the impedances connected to the capacitors model the antenna loading. The associated \texttt{Circuit} is built from the code example given below. In this example, each network has been previously imported or created.

The full antenna, which consists in two adjacent similar circuits can be built similarly. \texttt{Circuit} allows visualizing the circuit graph using the \href{https://networkx.github.io/}{\texttt{networkx}} package \sidecite{hagberg2008}, which is useful to check that the intended circuit is the one expected (such as connections, port numbers and characteristic impedances).

\subsection{Summary of this section}

\todo{design antenna}

The RF antenna model of the WEST ICRH antennas has been modelled using the open-source Python package \href{http://scikit-rf.org/}{\texttt{scikit-rf}}. The package provides a modern, object-oriented library for network analysis and calibration which is both flexible and scalable. As the package is developed in Python, it makes it naturally compatible with the rich and modern scientific Python libraries, testing and code coverage frameworks and reproducible modelling approaches using on-line virtualization services. The WEST ICRH antenna is modelled by connecting the various elements that compose it, separately full-wave modelled. Tunable elements, such as the matching capacitors, can be either created from ideal lump components or from interpolating full-wave calculations performed at various capacitance configurations. Being open-source, using \texttt{scikit-rf} to create the antenna numerical model with reproducible work-flow adds confidence in the fact that future users could use/maintain and extend it.

\subsubsection{“Grill” Antennas}
\todo{Power limit and multipactor in grill:\cite{hwang1981, vaughan1982, goniche2012-2, goniche2014} from vaughan1982:
	This suggests that multipactor in the Brambilla grill might be suppressed
	by making each of the dividing septa thicker in the middle than at the
	edges, to introduce a similar small lateral component of RF field. If
	successful, this would have the merit of being a "geometrical" not
	subject to change during the life of the equipment. Solutions to multipactor
	which depend on surface treatment orc onditioning are inherently
	less reliable, because further surface changes during life are not only
	possible but very probable.
	If tests are made of this suggestion, it is essential that the actual working
	environment be reproduced, most particularly the local magnetic
	field. Multipactor is a phenomenon strongly influenced by stray fields,
	and testsi n which they are norte presented are almost valueless.

\todo{If the window is located far from the plasma, then the electron cyclotron resonance layer can fall in the vacuum section of the guide. this condition can lead to breakdown.}



As the plasma cross-section dimensions of toroidal devices became sufficiently large to accommodate the free space wavelength at the lower hybrid frequencies, it becomes possible to couple the RF power directly by open-ended waveguides inserted in the vacuum vessel wall, thus avoiding coils or antennas within the vacuum chamber\footnote{To give some numerical orders, the COMPASS-D tokamak, operated in Culham from to 1989 to 2001, used 1.3 GHz RF power sources, and rectangular waveguides of cross-section 165x82mm to carry the RF power to the LH launcher. Smaller wavelengths (i.e. higher frequency sources, up to 8 GHz) have been used, leading to smaller waveguides cross-section.}.

However, in order for the wave to access from outside the plasma to inside the plasma, the wave has to be “slowed down” along the static toroidal magnetic field. This means that the parallel phase velocity of the wave $v_{\parallel}$ has to be reduced with respect to the speed of light $c_0$, in order to being able to penetrate trough the plasma. It is said that the waves must satisfy an \emph{accessibility condition} \sidecite{golant1972, stix1992}\footnote{The accessibility condition is sometime referred as the Golant's accessibility criterion, for e.g. in\sidecite{puri1974}.} Equivalently, this condition requires for the wave to have a sufficiently large refractive \emph{parallel index} $n_{\parallel} = c_0/v_{\parallel} = k_{\parallel}/k_0$, parallel to the magnetic field. The use of a phased array as a way to slow down the waves and thus to launch LH waves was first suggested by Lallia\sidecite{lallia1975} and investigated by Bernabei et al. in 1975\sidecite{bernabei1975}. Lallia suggested that a set of properly phased waveguides, called "grill"\footnote{The similarity to the cooking utensil leads to nickname these launchers "grill".}, would efficiently slow down the wave parallel to toroidal magnetic field. The short sides of the waveguides are mounted parallel to the toroidal magnetic field, to launch effectively a slow wave mode into the plasma. 

The coupling is the process by which RF power propagates and possibly tunnels from an antenna to the plasma \sidecite{Meneghini2012}. Brambilla developed the theory of the coupling of  a simplified grill structure to a large toroidal plasma \sidecite{brambilla1979} \footnote{The Brambilla theory has been applied (and still) to many different geometries, from single waveguide to hundred of waveguides array. Some examples are cited here, like a 2-waveguides array with one mode in \sidecite{krapchev1978} or to 16-waveguides array in \sidecite{stevens1988}.} This coupling theory has been generalized later to the fast wave coupling \sidecite{theilhaber1980} and to 3D rectangular waveguides in \sidecite{Bers1981, bers1983}. 

Several important remarks can be drawn from the properties of the propagation of cold-plasma waves into the plasma. The wave is evanescent if the electron density is below a cut-off density $n_{\mathrm{cutoff}}$. However, if such a low density layer is thin enough, the wave can tunnel through it. Thus, similarly to ICRF antennas, the LH launcher must be close enough of the plasma\footnote{Or the plasma local density must be increased by gas puffing.} in order to efficiently couple high power. 

In these conditions, the thermal and mechanical stresses are essential parameters to design an LH launcher. They and constitute a challenge to deliver such for these systems in for fusion reactors. As for ICRH antennas, LHCD launchers distributed in the vacuum vessel is being proposed for DEMO, mitigating substantially these issues.

Different types of grills have been developed to accommodate the conditions that the wave must be coupled to and (then) propagate in the plasma.

\subsubsection{Multijunction Launchers}\label{sec:multijunction}
In a large tokamak, a conventional LH grill made of independently fed waveguides would require hundred of waveguides, leading to a very complex power splitting design behind the antenna (cf.Figure \ref{fig:cmodlh1}). The use of \emph{multijunction} grill was suggested in 1984 to overcome this limitation \sidecite{gormezano1985}. In a multijunction grill, the main waveguide is divided into $N$ smaller (secondary waveguides) by thin metallic walls parallels to the wall of the main waveguide and perpendicular to the electric field: the \emph{E-plane N-junctions}. Built-in phase shifters made by reducing the waveguide height (in order to increase the guided wave phase velocity) are added in the structure in order to obtain the desired output phasing of the grill. Multijunction launcher makes it simpler to create and feed a large number or waveguides, at the contrary of classic grills launchers. However, a drawback is that the adjustment range of the power density spectrum is limited to a smaller range than for classic grills launchers.

A judicious choice of the phasing of the output waveguides leads to an important self-matching property of the multijunction (also known as \emph{recycling effect} or \emph{load resilience}). Indeed, for specific phase values, the reflected waves from the plasma which return back in the secondary waveguides can be reflected back to the plasma, thus leading to multiple reflections in the secondary waveguides. This recycling effect, which takes place between the plasma-antenna discontinuity and the E-plane bi-junctions, leads to an attenuation of the waves at each passage by the plasma, and ultimately to a decrease of the reflected power toward the RF sources. 

TODO: Illustration of the recycling effect (load resilience) inside a multijunction.

\subsubsection{Passive-Active waveguide array launchers}
One of the main show-stopper to the use of LHCD to realize long and efficient pulses (outside the constraints of the tokamak magnetic coils heating) is the ability to couple high LH power to the plasma. Indeed, in order to achieve good coupling, the electron density in front of the LH launchers needs to be large enough, which means that the launcher needs to be located close enough to the plasma or to increase the local density by gas puffing means. 

The alternation of \emph{passive} waveguide (a waveguide closed by a short-circuit) and \emph{active} waveguide (a waveguide that is directly fed from the generator) has been initially proposed by Motley and Hooke \sidecite{motley1980} in order to minimize the \emph{surface wave} excitation. Moreover, it was found that adding passive waveguide at each side of the array leads to decrease the reflected power in the last active guide \sidecite{krapchev1978, motley1980}. The passive waveguides act as reflectors, radiating back a part of the power reflected by the plasma, and thus improving the coupling efficiency. Passive-Active grills were envisaged since the 1980' for fusion-reactor grade devices \sidecite{ehst1982}. In these first conceptual designs, the passive waveguides were thought to be plugged or tuned individually in order for the outgoing power to have the requisite phase corresponding to an all-active grill system. 

Being close to the plasma leads to increase the heat fluxes into on the launcher front face. Thus, in order to improve the cooling of the launcher front face, it has been proposed in 1995 to insert one passive waveguide between each active waveguide, behind which a water pipe could efficiently water-cool the structure \sidecite{bibet1995}. 

In order to insure a lower reflected power than a conventional grill, it has been proposed to associate this alternation of passive-active waveguide to  use a multijunction. This Passive-Active Multijunction (PAM) concept addresses two of the main criticisms made to LH launchers, i.e. the coupling efficiency and the heat loads resilience.

\subsubsection{Poloidal splitter launchers}
Motivated by the reduction of the RF losses and the increase of the reliability of a LH launcher, while keeping the flexibility in the parallel index $n_{\parallel}$ spectrum of the “grill” configuration (at the contrary of multijunction), the Alcator C-Mod team developed in 2008 a launcher (LH2) based on a four way splitter \sidecite{koert2009}. At the contrary of multijunction launcher, the four way splitter divides the power in the poloidal direction. Since the power splitting is done poloidally, the launched parallel power spectrum can be changed with the same flexibility as with conventional grill antennas. This design simplified the feeding structure of the antenna, thus reducing the RF losses due to multiple power splitters and flanges of previous grill configurations, while keeping a simple manufacturing assembly. The RF power is redistributed depending on the plasma load on each of the four rows of the splitter. If the load is the same for each row, the power is evenly split among rows. The RF optimization of the launcher has been made for a source frequency of 4.6 GHz and assuming a simplified plasma load (constant) in front of each row. A similar design has been made for the KSTAR tokamak, at 5~GHz \sidecite{kim2012, kim2019}.

\subsubsection{LH Launchers main figures of merit}

There are three important figures of merit to measure the efficiency and the performances of a LH launcher: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The first one is the k-space radiated power spectrum, generally characterized by its \emph{parallel power spectrum} $p(n_{\parallel})$ . This quantity represents the amount of power for each parallel index excited by the launcher. The relation between this power spectrum and the array excitation is related to the Fourier transform of the electromagnetic field at the plasma-antenna interface. 
	
	\item  The second one is the ratio of the reflected power (at the mouth or at the end of the launcher) to the input power, named the \emph{reflection coefficient} (sometime expressed in percent). 
	$$RC = \frac{P_r}{P_f}$$
	\item The third one is the \emph{directivity} of the launcher, which is the fraction of the power spectrum over its total power content. It can be viewed as the fraction of the power that goes toward one toroidal direction over the total coupled power. One can define the directivity as follow\footnote{Other definitions exist, essentially in order to ad a physical content to the directivity, in relation with the current drive efficiency evolution in the plasma. See for instance \sidecite{Litaudon1990a}.}
	$$
	D
	= 
	\frac{
		\int_{n_{\parallel} >0} p(n_{\parallel}) dn_{\parallel} 
	}{
		\int_{n_{\parallel}} p(n_{\parallel}) dn_{\parallel} } 
	$$
\end{enumerate}

Theoretically, if the $n_{\parallel}$ spectrum of an antenna is known, one can evaluate the reflection coefficient. However, since the wave field at the launcher aperture (and thus the launcher spectrum) depends on the plasma itself, numerical codes are required to make a self-consistent numerical evaluation of the coupling. Such codes are coupling codes.

% #####################################################
\subsubsection{LH systems and launchers performances}
Mainly because of its relative simplicity, most of the LH launchers have been based on a "grill" configuration, as for example in the 1980' \sidecite{porkolab1984, gormezano1986, stevens1988}.

Typical grill launchers have a high reflection coefficient (of the order of 20 to 40\%) but directivity higher than 80\%. Since all the waveguides can be feed by independent RF sources, and thus independently phased, such launchers have a wide flexibility in terms of operational space (excited spectrum) which is of great interest for physics studies. However, since each waveguide is independently power fed, the complexity of the launcher grows enormously with the number of output waveguides, leading to cumbersome transmission systems for multi-megawatt power levels (Table \ref{tab:grillperformances}). 

\begin{table}
	{\rowcolors{2}{Apricot}{Dandelion}
		\begin{tabular}{| p{6cm} | p{5cm} |}
			\hline 
			Launcher & Total number of waveguides \\
			\hline \hline
			PLT Grill 1 (1981-1984)  \sidecite{stevens1988} & 6 (0.8 GHz) \\

			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	}
	\caption{Waveguide number and maximum performances in some grill launchers.}
	\label{tab:grillperformances}
\end{table}

Multijunction launchers at the contrary have led to hundred of waveguides launchers (see Table \ref{tab:multijunctionperformances}). The complexity of the multijunction design and manufacturing is balanced by the a simpler transmission line system behind the launcher. Because of the self-matching property, the typical reflection coefficient of multijunction launchers is generally less than 10\%. However, the multiple back and forth of the waves leads to an increase of the peak electric field in secondary waveguides. Moreover, since the phase shift is created by the built-in phase shifter inside the launcher, the flexibility of phase configuration is reduced in comparison to classic grill launchers. 

\begin{table}

The PAM concept tested in FTU and in the Tore Supra tokamak showed that reflected power lower than 5\% (i.e. high coupling efficiency) and continuous operations could be combined (cf. Figure \ref{fig:ts45472c4ir}) during long pulse operations.

\subsection{ITER LHCD Antenna}\label{sec:ITER_LHCD_antenna}
\marginnote{Part of this section are taken from paper \cite{hillairet2011, hillairet2013}.}
The high current drive efficiency of lower hybrid waves makes Lower Hybrid Current Drive (LHCD) system a crucial actuator to sustain a fraction of the non-inductive current drive in tokamaks. Simulations of ITER scenarios show that LHCD can help saving the poloidal flux consumption during ramp-up phases and thus extends significantly the flat-top duration. Although not part of the initial ITER planned procurement phase, a 20~MW/CW 5~GHz LHCD system was expected to be commissioned and used for the second mission of ITER\sidenote{Since 2008, the LHCD system has been removed from the list of the heating and current drive systems of ITER\cite{iterorganization2018}.}, i.e. Q=5 steady state target. In 2011-2013, as part of an international work leaded by CEA/IRFM, CEA/IRFM made a particular R\&D effort in order to validate the design and the performances of 5~\si{GHz} LHCD system for ITER\sidecite{hoang2009-1}. 

Depending on the plasma scenarios (steady-state, hybrid, ramp-up, etc.), the additional current driven by LHCD would range between 0.42 MA (steady-state) up to more than 3.0~MA (ramp-up) \sidecite{decker2011}. In any case, these values confirm that for steady state scenarios, a substantial bootstrap current is required \sidecite{jacquinot1999}. The average current drive efficiency, which is the figure of merit of the LHCD, has been calculated to be $\eta \equiv 0.2 \times 10^{20} \si{A m^{-2} W^{-1}}$, similar to the ones measured in present days tokamaks \sidecite{jacquinot1999}. This value  can be compared to other additional current drive scheme, such as NBI or ECCD. 

On the technological aspect, the Passive Active Multijunction launcher concept has been validated on FTU\sidecite{pericoli-ridolfini1999} and in steady-state conditions at 3.7~\si{GHz} on Tore Supra (Cf. previous Section) \sidecite{ekedahl2010}. For this reason, the ITER LHCD antenna design is based on a PAM antenna. However, its scalability to 5~\si{GHz} especially in terms of high power handling and Continuous Wave (CW) operations remains to be demonstrated. 

In ITER, a main parallel index of the launched waves $n_{\parallel 0} \approx 2.0$ has been selected as a trade-off between the current drive efficiency, the wave accessibility and the location of power deposition, all of which depend upon the plasma conditions\sidecite{becoulet2011}. In frame of an international work leaded by CEA/IRFM, a new arrangement of PAM has been studied in order to allow a larger $n_{\parallel}$ flexibility compared to the previous design\cite{bibet2005-1}, i.e. increasing the peak $n_{\parallel}$ range from $\left[1.9-2.1\right]$ to $\left[1.8-2.2\right]$. 

\begin{figure}

	\caption{Illustration of the conceptual design of the ITER LHCD antenna. }
	\label{fig:iterlhantenna}
\end{figure}

In this design, the launcher is made of 48 identical modules, each one independently fed by one klystron: twelve in the toroidal direction and four in the poloidal direction. A module consists of four active waveguides in the toroidal direction and six lines of waveguides in the poloidal direction (Figure~\ref{fig:3D-view_1module}). Thus, the whole launcher contains 1152 active waveguides whose dimensions are $9.25\times58$~mm. The RF power is carried through a transmission line up to a RF window
located inside the frame and connected to a poloidal 3~dB splitter which feeds two $\TE_{10}-\TE_{30}$ mode converters. Each of these mode converters converts the incident power from the rectangular $\TE_{10}$ mode to the rectangular $\TE_{30}$ mode in order to divides the power into three poloidal rows, corresponding to the input of a 4-active waveguides multijunction. 

\begin{figure}

		two mode converters and the six PAM multijunctions. All the elements
		of a module located behind the RF window are under the machine vacuum.}
	\label{fig:3D-view_1module}
\end{figure}

An illustration of the multijunction design, with four active waveguides per toroidal line is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Illustration_4awg_design}. The passive waveguides, not illustrated in the Figure, are inserted between each active waveguides. In this design, the active waveguides (of width $b_{a}=9.25$~mm) are wider then passive waveguides ($b_{p}=7.25$~mm). The waveguides height ($a=58$~mm) avoids the higher mode $\TE_{20}$ to propagate and is close to the WR229 standard ($58.17\times29.08$~mm). 

The structure has been optimized in order to reach the following goals: i) minimize the reflected power, ii) insure a $270\si{\degree}$ phase shift between adjacent active waveguides. The estimated return loss of the optimized structure is $-34$~dB while the phase difference between adjacent output waveguides is $270\si{\degree} \pm 0.7\si{\degree}$. The transmitted power $\left|S_{n1}\right|^{2}$ (with $n=\{2,3,4,5\})$ is $1/4\pm7\times10^{-3}$ which means that the input power is well divided into the 4 output of the multijunction. The maximum electric field on matched ports is 346~kV/m for a power input of 250~kW, the propagation loss $1-\sum_{n} \left| S_{n1} \right|^{2}$ for copper walls is 1.2\% and the total length of the multijunction illustrated in Figure\ref{fig:Illustration_4awg_design} is $1.170$~m.

\end{figure}

The waveguide phasing is provided by one 180\si{\degree} phase shifter (in the second bi-junction) and three 90\si{\degree} phase shifters. 6 identical multijunctions are used to fill one row of a module of the ITER LHCD antenna. As in the 2001 initial design, 3 multijunctions disposed in a poloidal column are fed by a $\TE_{10}-\TE_{30}$ mode converter. This mode converter is detailled in Section~\ref{sec:mode_converter}.

The plasma coupling have been calculated using the ALOHA code\sidecite{hillairet2010} for 6 side-by-side modules, forming rows of 24 active waveguides. As a particular attention has been made on the power division in this model, thus on the reflected power due to the mechanical phase shifters. These phase shifters have been optimized in order to provide the expected relative phase shift thus to minimize the VSWR. As a result, the average reflection coefficient (Figure~\ref{fig:iterlhrc}) of this structure is lower than the 2001 version waveguide model, remaining below that 2\% over a large density range and showing that the reflected power of a multi-junction is almost as dependant to the RF structure than the edge plasma parameters.

\end{figure}

The maximum and averaged electric fields are plotted on Figure~\ref{fig:iterlhelectricfield}. As in the 2001 design, the electric field is maximum near the cut-off density (740-800~\si{kV/m} for $n_{e0}/n_c=1$) and is in the 580-600~\si{kV/m} range for $n_{e0}/n_c=2$. Above the cut-off, the average electric field is below 300~kV/m and decreases for higher densities.

\subsection{5 GHz ITER $\TE_{10}$-$\TE_{30}$ Mode Converters}\label{sec:mode_converter}
\marginnote{Part of this section are taken from \citeauthyear{hillairet2012, hillairet2020} and internal technical notes.}

\subsubsection{Context}
The aim of the $\TE_{10}$-$\TE_{30}$ mode converter is to convert an input fundamental Transverse Electric (TE) rectangular mode ($\TE_{10}$) into another rectangular mode (the $\TE_{30}$ mode). This conversion is then used in order to equally split the power in three in an adapted splitter. Such splitting scheme, used in both Tore Supra LH antennas since 1999, is achieved by a perturbation of the waveguide geometry leading to mode coupling. Fundamental input $\TE_{10}$ mode can thus be almost totally converted to the $\TE_{30}$ mode, which ideally distributes the power into three in the H-plane\sidecite{bibet1994, wang2009}. This wall perturbation mode conversion has been used originally on ECRH, where high-order modes are not suitable for long distance transmission and plasma heating \cite{thumm1987-1, thumm2002}. 

Propagation of guided field into small perturbed wall waveguides can be modelled with the Generalized Telegraphist's equation \sidecite{schelkunoff1952, schelkunoff1955, unger1958, solymar1959, buckley1990}. The resulting set of equations can be solved numerically \sidecite{flugel1988,huting1989} or almost analytically with some approximations\cite{unger1958, solymar1959}. 

We refer to the previous references for more details on the calculation principles.

\subsubsection{RF modelling}
\paragraph{Mode Converter}
The schematic drawing of a H-plane sinusoidal perturbated wall mode converter is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:SchematicMC}. In Figure \ref{fig:SchematicMC}, the input $\mbox{TE}_{10}$ mode is coming from the left. Input width $a_{0}$ must be set sufficiently large in order to permit the $\TE_{30}$ mode to propagate, leading to $a_{0}\geqslant90$~mm at 5~GHz. Output width $a_{1}$ is set to insure the $\mbox{T}\mbox{E}_{50}$ mode to cut-off, i.e. $a_{1}\leqslant150$~mm. The $\mbox{TE}_{40}$ modes is able to propagate at the output width $a_{1}$, however, an incident odd TE mode upon an H-plane discontinuity
with a longitudinal symmetry only excites odd TE modes in rectangular waveguides. A similar conclusion is obtained in the case of even modes\sidenote{See Ref.\sidecite{dusseaux2000, dusseaux2008} for an elegant derivation of this property}.  

\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/chap3/ITER_modeconverter/MC_SchematicCM}
	\caption{Schematic drawing (H-plane cut) of the $\TE_{10}-\TE_{30}$
		mode converter. }
	\label{fig:SchematicMC}
\end{figure}

The mode evolution along the mode converter is obtained by solving the generalized telegraphist's equations for a 3.5 periods deformed waveguide of wavelength $\lambda_{w}$ defined by the following sinusoidal
perturbation\cite{buckley1990, bibet1994}:

\begin{equation}
a(z)=a_{0}+\varepsilon\left(1-\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{\lambda_{w}}z\right)\right)\label{eq:sinusoidalPerturbation}
\end{equation}
In order to reach the best mode conversion to $\TE_{30}$ mode, a numerical optimization of parameters $a_{0}$, $\varepsilon$ and $\lambda_{w}$ has been made in Matlab using a Generalized Telegraphist's equation solver. This first optimization led to dimensions $a_{0}=98$\,mm, $\varepsilon=22.4$\,mm and $k_{w}=2\pi/\lambda_{w}=36.3059\,\mbox{m}^{-1}$.

\begin{marginfigure}

	\caption{HFSS RF model of the mode converter (without taper at the input).}
	\label{fig:HFSS-RF-modelMC}
\end{marginfigure}

Further optimization of these parameters have been made into ANSYS HFSS, taking into account RF conduction losses on walls. In order to avoid spurious mode generation or numerical instabilities, some extra straight rectangular waveguides have been added at the input and output of the HFSS model (Figure \ref{fig:HFSS-RF-modelMC}).  This optimization led to the dimensions reported in Table \ref{tab:DimensionsMC}, which are very close to the ones found in Matlab.

\end{table}

The return loss for the fundamental mode is 20.5~dB. Propagation losses for copper plating walls, calculated as $1-\sum_{j}\left|S_{j1}\right|^{2}$, is 1.36\%. The bandwidth of the device, defined as the range of frequencies for which at least 95\% of the $\TE_{10}$ mode is converted to $\TE_{30}$, is 120~MHz.
The length of the device is, without taking into account input and output straight rectangular waveguides, 606~mm.


In order to feed the mode converter with a standard WR-229 waveguide ($a=58.17$~mm, $b=29.08$~mm), 
an input taper has to be added to match the WR-229 width. This taper is described in the next section.

% #####################################################
\paragraph{Input Taper}
\begin{marginfigure}
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/chap3/ITER_modeconverter/HFSS_ModeConverterTaper}
	\caption{RF Model of the Input Taper. }
	\label{fig:taper}
\end{marginfigure}
In order to make the transition between the input width $a_{0}$ of the mode converter and the conventional waveguide WR-229 width which is 58~mm, an extra taper must be added at the input (instead of the straight rectangular waveguide used before). A cosine taper has been modelled with the following width equation:

\begin{equation}
a(z)=\frac{1}{2} 
\left(a_{\mbox{WR229}}+a_{0}\right)
+\frac{1}{2}\left(a_{\mbox{WR229}}+a_{0}\right)
\cos\left[\left(\frac{z}{L_{taper}}-1\right)\pi\right]
\end{equation}
where $L_{\mbox{taper}}$ is the total length of the taper, $a_{\mbox{WR229}}$ is the WR-229 width (58.17\,mm) and $a_{0}$ the input width of the mode converter. The model has been drawn in ANSYS HFSS and then optimized in combination with mode converter. Scattering parameters are reported in Table \ref{tab:S-ParametersALL}. Let us define the forward mode conversion efficiency as the ratio between the power carried by the $\TE_{30}$ over the total forward power. According to the S-parameters, the theoretical mode conversion efficiency is close of 99.5\%.

	\caption{RF CAD of the poloidal splitter.}

\end{marginfigure}
The poloidal splitter aims to split the power coming from the mode converter, which is mainly a pure $\mbox{TE}_{30}$ mode, into three distinct waveguide sections. This poloidal divider is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:PoloidalSplitterCAD}. It has been optimized first alone in order to maximize the power splitting when exciting with a $\mbox{TE}_{30}$ mode, then with the mode converter fastened. The calculated scattering parameters of this device are reported in Table \ref{tab:PoloidalSplitter_Sparameters}.

	\label{tab:PoloidalSplitter_Sparameters}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Complete assembly}
The complete assembly, i.e. the mode converter associated to its input taper and the poloidal splitter has  a calculated return loss is 45.5~dB. The transmission losses are 4.79~dB $\pm$~0.01~dB for the three ports, close to the ideal value 4.77~dB which corresponding to the third of the input power. The scattering parameters evolution on a 4.9-5.1~GHz frequency band are reported in the next section.

\subsubsection{Low Power RF Measurements}
A low power mock-up of this 5~GHz mode converter (with its input taper) has been manufactured at CEA/IRFM using a 2-axis numerical drilling machine in Aluminum directly from the CAD model. The poloidal splitter as well as some other waveguide elements used only for measurement purposes, such as the "pull-over" described in the next section, have been manufactured by the SUMIX company from CAD models. The top of each elements has been screw tight in order to insure a very good RF contact (Figure~\ref{fig:ModeConverterMockUpElements}). 

\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/chap3/ITER_modeconverter/LH4ITER_ModeConverterMockUpElements}
	\caption{Manufactured low RF power mock-up elements. From top left to bottom right: mode converter,  "pull-over" and E-field probe waveguide support. }
	\label{fig:ModeConverterMockUpElements}
\end{figure}

The test bed used to measure the mode converter consisted in the assembly of the mode converter, the poloidal splitter and the ''pull-over''. The aim of this last element is only to facilitate the measurements by putting the output ports aside. Some WR187-WR229 tapers have also been added at each ports in order to match the commercially available WR187 waveguide-to-coaxial transitions (Figure~\ref{fig:RFTestBed}).

	\label{fig:RFTestBed}
\end{figure}

RF measurements indicate a return loss of 40~dB and a transmission loss of 4.78~dB $\pm$~0.03~dB for the three ports, very close from the ideal 4.77~dB corresponding to the third of the input power. Amplitude measurement results are illustrated in Figures \ref{fig:ModeConverter_S11} and \ref{fig:ModeConverter_S21}; results are in good agreement with the numerical modelling of the complete assembly. The phase shift between the side ports and the center port is $180\deg\pm5\deg$ as expected by the modelling.

\subsubsection{Mode Conversion Efficiency}
In order to measure the forward conversion efficiency from $\TE_{10}$ mode to $\TE_{30}$, a dedicated waveguide element has been manufactured. This element allows direct electric field probing of the mode converter output section, in which an almost pure $\TE_{30}$ mode is expected. This element is illustrated in Figures~\ref{fig:ModeConverterMockUpElements} (bottom right picture ) and \ref{fig:RFTestBed}. It consists in a straight waveguide of section $142.8~\si{mm}\times29.08~\si{mm}\times308~\si{mm}$, which matches the output section of the mode converter. Three rows of holes (2~mm diameter, 10~mm spaced) are drilled in the H-plane. These holes are made to support and block the probe in order to make the measurements at the exactly same spatial locations while holding the probe in a vertical position. The probe is inserted inside each hole sequentially and measures the amplitude and the phase of the electric field inside the waveguide. The coupling element is a thin 1mm diameter copper wire.  The probe ground potential is connected to the waveguide. The coupling has been measured to be -49~dB. Once the probe is inserted into a probe hole, the coupling element supersedes the waveguide wall by less than 1 mm. It is supposed from the small dimensions of the probe that the perturbations due to its use are negligible.  

From these electric field measurements, the modal content after the mode converter can then be deduced with the following method\sidenote{This method is not unique. This modelling is given  as exercise to students during the Master Fusion hands-on in Cadarache. Along the year, many different methods have been found and are summarized in  \href{https://github.com/jhillairet/documents/blob/master/notebooks/TP\%20Master\%20Fusion/LH-Hands-on-multijunction.ipynb}{this Jupyter Notbook}. }. We first assume that the electromagnetic field inside the waveguide is a linear combination of $\TE_{m0}$ modes only, then from at a point $(x,z)$ of the waveguide we have from Eq.(\ref{eq:rectwg_transverse_fields_sum_modes}):
\begin{equation}
\Ebf_{t}(x,z)
	=
	\sum_{m=1}^{N_{modes}}
	A_{m} \ebf_{m}^{+} \left(x,z\right) + B_{m} \ebf_{m}^{-} \left(x,z\right) 
\end{equation}
where $x$ is the largest side direction and $z$ is the propagation direction. The $\ebf_{m}^{\pm}$ terms are the analytic modal eigenfunctions describing forward and backward $\TE_{m0}$ modes shapes given in Eqs.(\ref{eq:TEmodes_eingenfunctions}). $A_{m}$ and $B_{m}$ are the associated forward and backward weight coefficients.  The aim of the method is to find the $2\times N_{modes}$ best coefficients $A_{m}$,$B_{m}$  in order to minimize the squares of the error $\chi^{2}$ between the theoretical field and the measured field:
\begin{equation}
\chi^{2}\left(A_{m},B_{m}\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{N_{mes}}\left(E_{mes,i}-E_{th,i}\right)^{2} 
\end{equation}
Solving this problem leads to the forward $A_{m}$ and backward $B_{m}$ coefficients, and thus to the forward mode conversion efficiency which can be defined as the ratio between the power carried by the $\TE_{30}$ over the power carried by all forward modes, i.e:
\begin{equation}
\eta=\frac{\left|A_{3}\right|^{2}}{\sum_{n}\left|A_{n}\right|^{2}}\times100
\end{equation}

This efficiency has been calculated from the electric field probing after the mode converter to be $\eta=99.9$\%.

\subsubsection{Summary of this Section}
In the frame of the Lower Hybrid R\&D for ITER activities conducted at CEA/IRFM, a low power mock-up of a $\TE_{10}-\TE_{30}$ mode converter at 5~GHz has been designed, manufactured and successfully validated with low power RF measurements. The next section is dedicated to another ITER LHCD system component, the RF windows.

\subsection{5 GHz ITER RF Window Design and Tests}\label{sec:RF_windows}
% ############################################
\subsubsection{Context}
\marginnote{Parts of this section are taken from \citeauthyear{hillairet2015}.}
A tokamak operates at pressures different from the transmission line pressure. RF windows intend to isolate these different pressures but allow propagation of the microwaves with low losses and limited RF power reflection. Vacuum vessel operates at ultra-low pressure, typically $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-6}$~\si{Pa}, while transmission lines can contain atmospheric pressure or pressurized gas to increase the breakdown voltage. Consequently, the window must be sufficiently strengthened to withstand differential pressures of the order of several tens of \si{kPa}. On the other hand, window must withstand mechanical stresses such as shock and vibration, and important temperature variations. Window failures can be caused by reflected power, vacuum arcs/multipactor or too much heat dissipation \sidecite{vaughan1961, ikeda1989, neuber1998, hemmert1998}. In the case of a fusion reactor such like ITER, the windows are also part of the first nuclear confinement barrier.

As the dimensions of the tokamak access ports are limited, the number of transmission lines connected to the antenna is limited too. In order to fit into the available space, to simplify the assembly design and to improve the maintenance of the system, the number of transmission lines and thus the number of RF windows must be kept as low as possible. This leads to increase the power handling capability of each transmission line, and ultimately of each window.

In the proposed ITER LHCD design (Cf. Section~\ref{sec:ITER_LHCD_antenna}), 24~\si{MW}~CW of RF power at 5~\si{GHz} are expected to be generated and transmitted to the plasma. In order to separate the vacuum vessel pressure from the cryostat waveguide pressure, forty eight 5~\si{GHz} 500~\si{kW} windows are to be assembled on the waveguides at the equatorial port flange. For nuclear safety reasons, 48 additional windows could be located in the cryostat section, to separate the cryostat waveguide pressure from the exterior transmission line pressure and to monitor it. Because the failure of a window would lead to lock a transmission line, these windows have been identified as one of the main critical components for the ITER LHCD system since first ITER LHCD studies \sidecite{bibet2005}. In order to initiate this R\&D effort, two 5~\si{GHz} 500~\si{kW}/5~s pill-box prototype windows have been developed and manufactured in 2012 by the PMB/ALCEN Company in close collaboration with the CEA/IRFM\sidecite{hillairet2014, hillairet2015}.

	\caption{Pill-box window schematics}
	\label{fig:pillboxwindow}
\end{marginfigure}

The proposed ITER 5~\si{GHz} RF window is based on a pill-box window concept \sidecite[+4cm]{ives1993,maebara1995}, i.e. a thin ceramic disc brazed in the middle of a short straight section of a circular waveguide axially connected on both sides to rectangular waveguides as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:pillboxwindow}. According to the transmission line theory, the pill-box window has four discontinuities: rectangular waveguide to circular waveguide, vacuum to ceramic and ceramic to vacuum and circular waveguide to rectangular waveguide. Typical design rule of thumb of such device is circular section diameter about the same size of the diagonal of the rectangular waveguide. Without taking into account the ceramic, the circular section length is approximately half a guided wavelength of the circular $\TE_{11}$ mode, in order to not generate spurious reflection into the rectangular sections. For a prescribed dielectric properties, the RF design consists in optimizing the geometrical dimensions of the window, mainly the diameter, the ceramic thickness and the vacuum circular waveguide length in order to minimize both RF reflection (matching) and RF power absorption in the ceramic (from trapped or ghost-mode heating \cite{ives1993} ). Once optimized, taking into account the ceramic, the matching is optimum only for a narrow band of frequency and is very sensitive to the device dimensions and the ceramic relative permittivity. As the klystrons used for fusion applications have narrow bandwidth, for instance 5~MHz at 3.7~GHz \sidecite[-1cm]{beunas2009, magne2011} or 5~GHz klystrons \sidecite{kenichihayashi2007, park2013}, the RF optimization is performed for the central frequency only. 

The heat losses in the ceramic, which have to be extracted by an active water cooling, depend on both the inside electric field topology and the ceramic dielectric loss (loss tangent). Undesirable modes due to parasitic resonances can be excited in the ceramic volume, raising the electric field and thus the heat dissipation. This aspect is uncorrelated from the return loss and one can even achieve low return loss but can have high heat losses in the ceramic (>2~\si{kW}) \sidecite{mirizzi2011}. So both aspects have to be taken into account during the RF optimization process.

	\caption{ITER 2001 Conceptual Design from \cite{bibet2001-1}}
	\label{fig:iterlhantennaold}
\end{marginfigure}


In the 2001 initial Lower Hybrid (LH) antenna design, 24 RF windows were set on the cryostat port. Each of them fed 2 RF windows installed on the vacuum port (illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:iterlhantennaold}). Since the antenna is designed for a power up to 20 MW, each RF window of the first and second group have to withstand respectively 833 kW CW and 417 kW CW . Two preliminary designs had been proposed in \sidecite[+3.5cm]{bibet2001-1}. However, the mechanical analysis performed in \sidecite[+4cm]{hoang2009-2} showed that stresses are higher than the static fatigue limit of 50 MPa. This particularly point invalidates the design for dynamic fatigue (cycles of repeated heating and cooling). Following this study, a new RF design has been developed. At the contrary of the model proposed in \cite{bibet2001-1}, a larger rectangular input section has been used (WR229 instead of WR187). It was found in \sidecite[+2cm]{hillairet2013} a range of dielectric thickness which combines low total dielectric losses (<650W) by minimizing the axial electric field in the ceramic and a low VSWR (S11<-25dB). We did not take into account in this study the impact of non-negligible amount of reflected power (>5\%), such as experimented on tokamak.

As highlighted in \sidecite{ao2014}, the relative dielectric properties of the ceramic disk depend on the manufacturer, even when the same manufacturer and ceramic batch are used. At the frequency of 5~GHz, the dielectric losses (loss tangent) of aluminium oxide (Al2O3), aluminium nitride (AlN) or Beryllium Oxyde (BeO) are of the same order ($\tan\delta \approx 10^{-4}$). The choice for BeO ceramic is motivated by its larger thermal conductivity (in the range of 330 to 370~\si{W/m/K} at room temperature) than the other ones (in the range of 30~\si{W/m/K} for Al2O3 and 70-180~\si{W/m/K} for AlN). BeO is used in high power 3.7~GHz and 5~GHz klystrons windows. In order to determine the final thickness of the windows, the BeO ceramic RF properties must be known with accuracy. A BeO sample has been requested from the ceramic manufacturer (American Beryllia) with the guarantee that the final ceramics will be made from the same lot. The sample has been characterized within a RF resonant cavity setup in collaboration with the XLIM laboratory\sidenote{The authors thanks Olivier Tantot and Damien Passerieux from the XLIM Laboratory in Limoges, France, where the dielectric measurements on BeO samples have been conducted.} \sidecite[+3cm]{lefloch2014}. The measurement of the BeO sample has been made at two surrounding frequencies and the results are given in \cite{hillairet2015}. The relative permittivity and the loss tangent at 5~GHz have been calculated from a linear interpolation of the measured values, to be $\varepsilon_{r}=6.36\pm0.159$ and $\tan \delta = 4.30\times 10^{-4}\pm3.82\times 10^{-5}$ respectively.

\end{marginfigure}

From these measurements, the final dimensions have been calculated by the PMB/ALCEN Company in collaboration with CEA. In the proposed design, a rectangular waveguide of section 58.17x29.08~\si{mm} (WR229 standard) is used to forward the RF power into the circular section. The ceramic disk diameter and the thickness are 85.89~mm and 8.3~mm respectively. Other dimensions are reported in Figure~\ref{fig:iterwindowsmaindimensions}. In order to increase the RF performance of the window, in particular the return loss, two matching inductive rods have been added on each side of the window. These rods also make possible an eventual post-manufacturing tuning, by slightly deforming them after the final assembly. This technique has also been used in the TED 3.7~GHz windows used on the Tore Supra tokamak, but with a larger rod diameter due to the reduced frequency.

\end{marginfigure}

The power loss in the ceramic volume and the electric field topology have been evaluated with finite element modelling (Figure~\ref{fig:iterwindowsrflossesceramic}. With the material properties cited above, the calculated dissipated power in ceramic is around 550~W for 500~kW input on matched load. Taking into account a conservative copper conductivity of 4.4~MS/m, the total resistive losses are estimated to 720~W (Figure~\ref{fig:iterwindowsrflosses}). Combined, the expected total RF losses for the window to evacuate is thus of the order of 1.27~kW.

In order to conform to ITER acceptance criteria for vacuum feedthroughs \sidecite{waldon2008}, the maximum pressure on the ceramic (air) has been specified to be 3~bars absolute (0.3~MPa). The water cooling circuit specifications has been specified in accordance with the NFRI 5~GHz klystron test-bed in which the high power tests have been performed\sidecite{do2011, kim2019-2}. The maximum pressure on the cooling circuit has been set to 6~bars, with a maximum pressure drop on the cooling circuit for a 8~L/min flow of 0.3~bar\footnote{It has to be noted that these specifications are well below the ITER port plug specifications, for which the water temperature and pressure are expected to be 70-100$\si{\celsius}$ up to 40~bars in cooling mode and up to 250$\si{\celsius}$ and 45~bars in baking mode. However, such conditions are challenging because the copper skirt thickness has to be increased to sustain such a pressure. Increasing the skirt thickness in order to withstand a 40-45~bars pressure will reduce the cooling efficiency. Moreover, if the skirt is thicker, the mechanical constraints on the ceramic due to the differential thermal expansion between the BeO and Cu will be more severe since the skirt will be stiffer. For this reason, the present proposed prototype design only focuses on the RF performances.}. 

Assuming an inlet flow of 8~L/min and an outlet return pressure of 1.5~bar specified by the water cooling loop system, the fluid velocity calculated from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling in ANSYS Fluent at the 10~mm diameter inlet is 1.7~m/s. Figure~\ref{fig:iterwindowswatervelocity} illustrates the water velocity in half of the cooling section. The flow in the fluid section is mainly turbulent, as the Reynold number at the inlet/outlet is of the order of 10000 and 40000 in the skirt. Since inlet and outlet have been located normal to the skirt, the water velocity rise up to 4.6 m/s at the interface between the pipe and the skirt. However, the flow is rapidly homogenous in the skirt and with lower velocities (cf. Figure~\ref{fig:iterwindowswatervelocity_closeup_skirt}), leading to an homogenous cooling of the ceramic. The average value of the heat transfer coefficient is H=12300~\si{W.m^{-2}K^{-1}} on the inner side of the skirt. The water pressure is homogenous inside the skirt and the estimated pressure drop is 0.12~bar. Cavitation regime is not expected in the cooling section, as the cavitation number is more than two orders of magnitude above the critical threshold ($\mathrm{Ca}\approx 1$) in all situations.\marginnote{The \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_number_(physics)}{Cavitation number} ($\mathrm{Ca}$) is a dimensionless number used in flow calculations. It expresses the relationship between the difference of a local absolute pressure from the vapor pressure and the kinetic energy per volume, and is used to characterize the potential of the flow to cavitate. }

\end{marginfigure}

The thermal model of the window has been set-up using loading from both the electromagnetic (heat load on walls and ceramic) and CFD models (convection on the skirt). A first thermal steady-state study has been conducted to survey the maximum reached temperature. The thermal loads come from the RF losses in the ceramic and on the waveguides walls and coupled to the thermal model. The thermal sinks come from water cooling and air radiation. The rectangular waveguide parts and the skirt are modelled as OFHC copper. The connections between the elements, especially between the BeO and the copper skirt, are modelled as perfect (bonded). The mechanical parameters of the BeO used in the thermal model are reported in \cite{hillairet2015}. The thermal conductivity of the BeO has been kept constant with respect to the temperature. However some studies indicate however that the thermal conductivity drops with temperature\sidecite{defaoite2012}, which would increase the BeO temperature. 

As the matching rods are not directly cooled by the water circuit, their temperatures reach 180$\si{\degreeCelsius}$ after a 5 seconds pulse and nearly 290$\si{\degreeCelsius}$ in steady-state regime. For this reason, the nominal RF pulse duration of these prototypes has been limited to be 5 seconds as a conservative approach. For a CW design, cooling pipes on the upper and lower parts of the rectangular waveguides would solve the problem.

In the ceramic, the maximum temperature is reached at the centre where the dielectric loss density is the maximum and which is also the farthest point from the water heat sink. Starting from an initial water temperature of 22$\si{\degreeCelsius}$, the ceramic centre temperature is calculated to be 75$\si{\degreeCelsius}$ after a 5 s/500 kW pulse (Figure~\ref{fig:iterwindows_thermal_modeling}). The initial temperature of the ceramic is recovered after nearly 10 s, as illustrated in Figure 8. In order to limit the mechanical stresses on the ceramic, the temperature difference between the centre and the periphery of the disk must be kept under a safety limit of 80$\si{\degreeCelsius}$. This limit has been determined by both mechanical modelling and rule of thumb, in order to keep stresses in the ceramic below the static fatigue limit.

\end{marginfigure}
Two RF windows have been manufactured by the PMB/ALCEN Company in collaboration with CEA/IRFM (Figure~\ref{fig:iterwindowspicture}). For ensuring the possibility to perform ITER relevant tests, like high temperature baking up to 240$\si{\degreeCelsius}$ , the window flanges are non-standard and have been designed to be compatible for both Viton or Helicoflex seals. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:iterwindowsgeometry}, a rectangular groove is machined on both sides of the window. Male waveguide adapters are then required to connect the window: these adapters are designed to insure a good electrical contact at the flange by a heel slightly longer than the groove depth, in order to dissociate the electrical contact from the sealing aspects. In return, additional elements must be connected together, which can lead to additional losses in the transmission line.

\end{figure}

BeO ceramic has a high secondary electron emission coefficient, which enhances multipactor induced breakdown probability. In order to suppress the multipactor induced breakdown at the surface of the ceramic, a 10~\si{nm} titanium nitride (TiN) coating is applied by vapour deposition. This coating intends to decrease the secondary emission yield of the ceramic and to improve the electrical charge exchange \sidecite{lorkiewicz2004} . Stainless-steel parts facing the RF fields are copper coated (10 to 20~$\si{µm}$).  After brazing the rectangular copper waveguides elements together, the stainless-steel parts are TiG welded. 

Low power RF measurements (dBm level) are reported in Figure~\ref{fig:iterwindowsrl} for both windows, labelled \#1 and \#2. The return losses ($S_{11}$ and $S_{22}$) at 5~GHz are below -32~dB (SWR < 1.05:1) in accordance with the RF modelling. The optimum frequency is shifted to low frequencies by 20 to 40~MHz, for reasons that will be explained in the next section. It has to be noted that the return losses $S_{11}$ and $S_{22}$ are not symmetrical for both windows, differently from the results of the RF modelling. This fact is attributed to both the measurement errors (which come from RF cables) and the matching rods which were deformed during manufacturing. These deformations, due to a handling problem during the copper coating operation, have been experienced for both windows. Even if the rods have been reshaped with specific tooling as best as possible, slight mechanical differences exist between each rods (at the contrary of the RF model which is ideal and perfectly symmetric).

	\caption{Return loss [\si{dB}] for both windows. RF modelling prediction(plain black) from HFSS}
	\label{fig:iterwindowsrl}
\end{figure}

The insertion losses ($S_{21}$) are reported in Figure~\ref{fig:iterwindowsil}. They have been measured at 5~GHz in the range from -0.01 dB to -0.05 dB (i.e. between 0.23\% and 1.14\% of input power). The overall uncertainty of the transmission losses measurements is of the order of 0.03 dB. These measurements reflected not only the window transmission losses but also the part of the assembly for which no calibration was possible (such as the dedicated waveguides adapters with specific flanges). Precise measurements of the insertion losses are very sensitive to the test bed mechanical assembly, in particular to the quality of the mechanical assembly of all flanges.

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{High Power RF Tests}
High power measurements have been performed on the NFRI LH test bed in 2013 and 2014. The setup shown in Figure~\ref{fig:iterwindowsrftests} consists in a single window inserted in the transmission line. The transmission line is filled with SF6 gas. A vacuum test with both windows at the same time using an interspace pumping system was also expected in case of successful completion of the tests of both prototypes. The windows were cooled with 8 to 17~\si{L/min} water flow at 20-25$\si{\degreeCelsius}$. Calorimetric measurements of the window water cooling loop were recorded during shots and used to estimate the power losses in the window\sidecite{park2013}. The temperature of the ceramic core was monitored by an infra-red camera (Agema thermovision 900, spectral range 2-5.4 \si{µm}) during 500~kW RF power shots. The measured BeO temperature depends on the BeO emissivity which is unknown. An absolute temperature calibration has been performed between 24.3$\si{\degreeCelsius}$ to 81.$\si{\degreeCelsius}$ using electrical blanket heating and shows a linear trend. Higher temperatures are deduced assuming linear interpolation of the calibration curve. 

\begin{figure}

	\caption{High power test setup at 5GHz/500kW NFRI test bed in Korea.}
	\label{fig:iterwindowsrftests}
\end{figure}

The RF energy applied for both windows is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:iterwindowspulseenergy} as a function of the pulse number. The RF power has been applied during single pulses length of 100~ms starting from 25~kW, and then the power was increased progressively pulse by pulse by 25~kW steps up to 250~kW. RF pulse length has been increased progressively (in more than 30~pulses) up to 2.5~s at a power of 250~kW. The RF power has been increased up to 500~kW during 100~ms pulses, then the pulse length have been increased to few seconds at 500~kW, in more than 50 pulses. Repetitive pulses at 500 kW have been performed for different pulse lengths. A single breakdown event has been detected via the optical fiber protection system at 250~kW. The fraction of reflected power measured close to the klystron output ranged from -22.6~dB to -21.6~dB (VSWR 1.16:1 to 1.18:1) for the first window and from -21.2~dB to -20.8~dB (VSWR 1.19:1 to 1.2:1) for the second window. It has to be noted that the return losses are inclusive of the return losses produces by both the window and the whole assembly, including its various components such as bends and water loads, for which a -24.9~dB (VSWR 1.12:1) return loss has been measured without the window installed in the transmission line.

\begin{figure}

	\caption{Pulse Energy in kJ as a function of the pulse number for both windows.}
	\label{fig:iterwindowspulseenergy}
\end{figure}

The water temperature increase $\Delta T$ during the RF power application from calorimetric measurement indicated a power loss in the device from 0.89\% to 1.1\% of the input power for the first window and of 0.7\% for the second window. This power loss includes the ceramic but also all the neighbouring copper-plated waveguide sections at both sides of the window, which were not water-cooled during these tests. This value is well above the 0.2\% expected from RF modelling or best measured values, but is consistent with the lowest range of values from low-power measurements reported in Section~\ref{sec:ITER_windows_manuf_low_power_tests}. These values are also in the same range of the ones measured on the Toshiba 5 GHz RF windows which equipped the klystron\sidecite{kim2019-2} . Total loss versus input power for both windows is reported in Figure 14 and shows linear trends. Two trend curves are related to the first window (1.1\% and 0.89\% of the incident power Pin) and the third one to the second window (0.73\% of Pin). The total losses are larger in the first window than in the second window, in consistence with low power measurements. The difference in the trends for the first window is not explained and is thought to come from measurement dispersion. These linear trends exclude eventual non-linear loss processes during these short-length pulses (up to 5 s).

\end{figure}

Infra-red (IR) measurements of the ceramic temperature have been made during high power pulses.  The rods small diameter (1.6 mm) makes its temperature measurement difficult because of the camera resolution, but also mainly because of the IR reflections occurring on them. When the ceramic temperature is increasing, the rods become undistinguishable from the ceramic. Some thermocouples have been placed at the top of the window (cf Figure~\ref{fig:iterwindowsgeometry}), located specifically over the matching rods, but no change of temperature during the pulses was measured, in agreement with modelling. The ceramic central temperature (maximum temperature), measured by the IR camera after 3 seconds pulses at 500 kW (Figure 15), is recurrently higher than 250$\si{\degreeCelsius}$, and thus higher than the thermal modelling prediction illustrated in Figure 8 which was below 100$\si{\degreeCelsius}$ after a 5 s pulse. 

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{figures/chap3/ITER_window/ITER_windows_BeO_temperature}

	\label{fig:iterwindowsbeotemperature}
\end{figure}

Moreover, the cooling time constant is around twice larger than expected from ideal thermal modelling, indicating that a thermal barrier reduces the heat conduction efficiency. The losses are not affected by a degradation of the cooling efficiency as the dissupated power does not depend on the thermal conductivity (if we assume that the dielectric loss tangent does not change with the temperature increase). 

The fact that the BeO central temperature increases to temperatures higher than 300$\si{\degreeCelsius}$ prevent these two windows prototype to be used in CW regime at full power without exceeding the mechanical stress limits of the ceramic. The first ceramic window prototype was found to be cracked after disassembly from the test-bed. Following this observation, the maximum power and the pulse length has been reduced for the following tests of the second window, in order not to exceed a maximum IR measured temperature of 100$\si{\degreeCelsius}$ to avoid high temperature gradient between the ceramic core and its periphery cooled by the 20-25$\si{\degreeCelsius}$ water loop. 



\subsubsection{Experimental Results Analysis}

Following the high power tests, two 16 mm diameter samples have been machined from the first (cracked) BeO ceramic window. A post-mortem RF analysis of these two samples has been performed with the same methodology used for the manufacturer sample (Cf. Section\ref{sec:ITER_windows_manuf_low_power_tests}). The relative permittivity measured on these two pieces was $6.74\pm0.12$ and $6.72\pm0.01$, to be compared with the 6.36 value originally measured on the manufacturer sample. The $\tan \delta$ was also up to twice higher than expected from the BeO sample measurement (from $5.4\times10^{-4}$ up to $8.8\times10^{-4} \pm 1.1\times 10^{-5}$). RF modelling shows that the change of relative permittivity has little effect on the dielectric losses, indicating that no other higher order modes are excited in the ceramic. The change of permittivity shifts the optimum frequency by -20~MHz, which corroborates low power measurements (Figure~\ref{fig:iterwindowsrl}). A loss tangent value of $9\times10^{-4}$ leads to double the total losses in the ceramic. Doubling the dielectric loss tangent into an ideal thermal model leads to a BeO central temperature of nearly 140$\si{\degreeCelsius}$ after a 5~s pulse. However, even taking into account these changes in the reference RF model, the predicted total RF losses reach 2~kW, still far from the 5~kW and 2.5~kW measured by calorimetry for window \#1 and \#2 respectively. 

We observe in Figure~\ref{fig:iterwindowspowerloss} that the total losses are almost linear with respect to the input power, thus excluding any significant changes on the dielectric loss tangent or copper conductivity with temperature for these short-length pulses.  The effect of the reflected power from the waveguide bends and the water loads has been assessed and is marginal in the total RF losses evaluation. Adding small gaps between the bonded parts of the window or at the flange interfaces may possibly causes additional RF losses. However, a reliable estimate of these losses is difficult. As the power lost in the ceramic is linearly linked to the dielectric loss tangent, the latter is thought to be the dominant player.

As seen in Figure~\ref{fig:iterwindowsrftests}, the window is connected to copper waveguide adapters on both sides. Each side is the addition of two waveguide sections of 140~mm and 248~mm length respectively. As these waveguides attached to the window were not actively cooled, a fraction of the RF power lost into them participates to the power balance measured by the calorimetric method. With a realistic copper conductivity of $\sigma=44~\si{MS/m}$, the conduction losses  from Eq.(\ref{eq:rectwg_power_loss_per_unit_length}) for a WR229 waveguide at 5~GHz for 500~kW are 2.9~kW/m. Taking into account only the two 140 mm length waveguides, the power balance leads to an additional RF power loss of 810~W. Taking into account all the waveguides length (140~mm + 248~mm) the power balance leads to an additional RF power loss of 2300~W. However, estimating the real fraction of power lost in these waveguides and dissipated into the window water cooling loop is delicate because of the large uncertainty of the thermal contacts between flanges. 

Taking into account the post-mortem BeO RF properties in the RF model leads to an insertion loss of -0.02 dB (0.5\%) and -0.03 dB (0.7\%) if one includes the connection waveguides on each sides of the window. Modelling and measurements are then consistent if one assumes that between 5 and 20\% of the power measured by calorimetry is dissipated in the connection waveguides. These modelling however do not take into account the fact that the matching rods are slightly deformed.

The longer characteristic time measured from IR during cooling can be originated from either a decreased BeO thermal conductivity, a reduced water heat transfer coefficient or a thermal barrier between the BeO and the copper skirt. If the first two have little effect on the thermal modelling results, unless using non-realistic values, the latter is thought to be the main cause of a reduced cooling efficiency. The brazing layer is made of gold/copper alloys (Au50/Cu50) in order to avoid silver alloys, which are undesirable in ITER because of transmutation risks during the nuclear phase. This brazing material has a low thermal conductivity (in the order of 33~\si{W/m/K}). Moreover, in order to increase the wettability of the BeO to the brazing alloy, a metallization of the BeO periphery is performed using a Molybdenum/Manganese layer, with the addition of nickel plating. Both have also a low thermal conductivity. Taking into account the Molybdenum/Manganese layer which has an electrical conductivity about 6~MS/m in the RF model as an impedance boundary condition leads to increase the RF losses around the ceramic of about 10~W for 500~kW input. Thermal modelling of such brazing layers, which thickness is typically between 20 to 40~µm, is delicate and is highly sensitive to parameter values. However, the general trend when applying a degraded thermal contact at the interface between the BeO and the copper is a fast increase of the temperature rise time due to a thermal barrier effect and similarly an increase of the characteristic cooling time, both observed experimentally. 


\subsubsection{Summary of this section}
Two 5 GHz 500 kW/5 s windows have been designed and tested at high power in collaboration with NFRI. The window design relies on a symmetrical pill-box concept with a cylindrical beryllium oxide (BeO) ceramic brazed on an actively water cooled copper skirt. The ceramic RF properties have been measured on a manufacturer test sample in order to get realistic values for guiding the design. Low power measurements show return losses below -32 dB (VSWR < 1.05:1) and insertion losses between -0.01 dB and -0.05 dB (i.e. 0.23\% to 1.14\% of input power), with the optimum frequency shifted toward frequencies lower than the nominal one. High power tests conducted at NFRI show a total power loss of 1.1\% of the input power for one window and of 0.7\% for the second one, in agreement with the lowest range of cold RF measurement but not with initial RF simulations. These values are also in the same range than the ones measured on the two Toshiba 5 GHz RF windows which equipped the klystron. The ceramic temperature during RF pulses has been found to reach unexpected high values, preventing these windows to be used under CW conditions because of the ceramic stress limits. 

Post-mortem RF measurement of two BeO samples of one of the windows shows that the dielectric relative permittivity of the ceramic was 6.7 while for the sample initially measured it was 6.36. More important, the measured dielectric loss tangent on the two post-mortem ceramic samples is up to twice as high as the manufacturer sample. The difference in the permittivity explains the shift of the optimum frequency.  RF modelling including the new dielectric properties of BeO, a more realistic RF conduction loss rate on copper and the additional connection waveguides, shows that the calculated RF losses match the observations. However, the only increase of the dielectric loss is not sufficient to explain the high temperatures measured with infrared camera. The higher temperature and delay time is explained by a thermal barrier due to ceramic metallization and the use of low thermal conduction brazing materials. 

 
This work shows that large margins must be taken from the reference design (or alternatively accept large production wastes), especially in cases where mechanical stresses are close to acceptable margins. It is believed that improvements in the manufacturing (in particular the brazing of the ceramic) and in the water cooling circuit are necessary to achieve the target performances.

Magnetic Fusion RF antennas are generally made of copper or silver-coated stainless steels located in vacuum environments. The vacuum sealing with pressurized transmission lines is made with the help of ceramics such as alumina, aluminium nitride, beryllium oxide or diamond. 

All these components are subject to multipactor discharges which increases the electron population (via secondary emission and gas desorption) which in turn may ultimately lead to an avalanche effect and the development of a discharge even at pressures two order of magnitude below Paschen breakdown limit\sidecite{graves2006}. These discharges are generally considered detrimental since they can lead to detuned RF systems, limit the RF power transmission in the plasma and eventually damage RF sources or components. When not detected quickly enough, arcs can lead to surface erosion \sidecite[-0.4cm]{goniche2012-2}, dielectric components metallisation \sidecite{wang2015} or water/air leaks due to punctured components such as bellows \sidecite{mayoral2007} or vacuum windows \sidecite{neuber1998, neuber2007, hillairet2015}. 

In some cases however, multipactor-induced discharges can be desired for vacuum RF conditioning during short RF pulses and at moderate power\sidecite{goniche2012-2, wang2015, halbritter1982, ekedahl1998}. Moreover, these RF systems are subjected to the high magnetic field environment of the experiments in the Tesla range. The presence of magnetic field affects the electron trajectories and thus the multipactor resonances. On tokamaks, the electron motion is strongly constrained around the magnetic field lines which reduce the effects of loss mechanisms such as diffusion and increases electron impact ionization and thus the build-up of glow discharges. Finally, at the difference of RF payloads in satellite, the antenna surfaces can be polluted during operation with particles resulting from the strong interaction of the energetic particles with the walls of the tokamak, which may alter the surface characteristics such as secondary emission. This paper reviews the work performed in the fusion research community on multipactor discharges for two kinds of RF systems with their practical implications on power delivery into the plasma. The Ion Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ICRH), which uses coaxial lines in the MHz range of frequency, is presented in the next section. The Lower Hybrid Current Drive (LHCD) systems, which uses rectangular waveguides in the GHz range of frequency is discussed in section 3.
